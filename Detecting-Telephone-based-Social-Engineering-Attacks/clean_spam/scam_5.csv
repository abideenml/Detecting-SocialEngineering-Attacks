23,"You see, for a limited time, we are allowing select members of the general public to invest in our gold and silver mines located in Texas.

24,"For a limited time, the International Mining Company is selling investment units for high-yield gold and silver mines located in southern Texas. Investments come with the guarantee that for every $1000 you put in, you get $3000 in return in just six months. This is with no risk of loss whatsoever!"

We guarantee that for each $1,000 you invest you will receive a $3,000 return on your money in just six months and there is no risk of loss your own money. Sound good?"
30,"I understand, Mrs. Johnson, and I appreciate your concern. However, you don’t need to know about the product in order to invest. For example, you probably don't know how to build a car—and neither do I—but that wouldn't keep us from investing in General Motors or Ford stock if we knew we would earn a lot of money. Doesn’t it make sense to look at the return on your investment and leave the mining to us, Mrs. Johnson?"
31,"Oh of course, sweetie, I’ll explain our process. So, we provide homes for the homeless, which involves buying land and building homes. With your $2,500 investment, we can build a townhouse that provides a home for a 3-5 person family. Thanks to you, a family that used to live in a tent can own a real home. As the cities we are located in start holding more residents and improve financially, we are able to return your $2,500 to you with an additional $7,500, totalling to $10,000."
32,"That’s understandable. It’s tough to make a decision without enough info. But, even if you don’t know how mining gold and silver works, it doesn’t mean that you can’t benefit from this opportunity. We’re experts in this, so you can trust us to do our jobs. "
33,"Thank you for your time, sir / madam. I am a representative of the Fast&Easy Gold Stock Investment company, and our mission is to ensure a standard of gold that will not dwindle as the price of everything goes up. I am here today to ask you for an $25,000 investment on gold for the future. If you agree to invest in us today, we will reward you with 1 ounce of pure gold, priced at around $2,000 to be sent in mail immediately. Does this interest you?"
34,That’s great. What if I was to tell you that you should have invested in Apple 15 years before and by now you would have been a millionaire.
35,"I totally understand your concern Mrs. Johnson. I should say that you probably don’t know much about how to build a car--and neither do I—but that wouldn’t keep us investing in General Motors or Ford stocks. At this juncture, I would advise you on grabbing this opportunity to multiply your investment and leave the mining to us. "
36,"I can totally understand your point of view. But think about it. For example, I do not know anything about computers, but if I had a chance of investing at Apple and missed it, I would have regretted it a lot later. This company will yield a lot more than you put in."
37,"For each $1,000 you invest you will receive a $3,000 return on your money in just six months and there is no risk of loss whatsoever. The investment is on Gold mining. The gold price worldwide is really doing well these days. Sound good?"
38,"Ma’am, I’m sorry to tell you, but in this day and age, you can’t expect to find financial stability if you do not invest your money. Investing is the only way that allows the average worker to climb up in society. With our company, not only will you begin your investing career, but you can also rest assured that you will not lose your money. On the contrary, you will triple your investments!"
39,"I completely understand your concerns, Mrs. Johnson. But think of it this way – you probably don’t know how to build a car, and neither do I, but that’s not going to prevent us from investing in General Motors or Ford if we knew it’d make us a lot of money. So, doesn’t it make sense to just look at the returns and leave the mining to us?"
40,You don’t have to know anything about it. Just like you don’t need to know how to build a car to invest in General Motors. Leave that to us while you just look at the money rolling in back to you. 
41,"I appreciate your concern. However, you probably don't know how to build a car, but that wouldn't keep us from investing in General Motors or Ford stock if we knew we would earn a lot of money. Doesn't it make sense, Mrs. Johnson, to just look at the return on your investment and leave the mining to us?"
42,"I appreciate your concern. However, you probably don't know how to build a car, but if we knew we would earn a lot of money that wouldn't keep us from investing in General Motors or Ford stock . Doesn't it make sense, Mrs. Johnson, to just look at the return on your investment and leave the mining to us?"
43,"I understand, Mrs. Johnson. However, you probably don't know how to build a car—and neither do I--but that wouldn't keep us from investing in General Motors or Ford stock if we knew we would earn a lot of money. Doesn't it make sense, Mrs. Johnson, leave the mining to us and just look at the return on your investment?"
44,"I appreciate your concern. Mrs. Johnson, However, you probably don't know how to build a car, but if we knew we would earn a lot of money, that wouldn't keep us from investing in General Motors or Ford stock Doesn't it make sense, Mrs. Johnson, to just look at the return on your investment and leave the mining to us?"
45,"The truth is, Mrs. Johnson, CDs are scams. The same goes for other common investments like savings deposits, Treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks. Your money just earns a pitiful 1 to 6 percent a year and the rich will stay rich and the poor will stay poor. What I'm talking about is putting an end to that. This is your chance to get a real return on your money and invest in the future of technology. Probably the hardest thing to do, Mrs. Johnson, is to make a decision. This one is an easy decision to make: your money will triple in return value!"
46,"Being completely honest with you Amy, it’s hard to find good investments elsewhere. I’ve personally tried a number of strategies, CDs, special savings accounts, Treasury bills, stocks, bonds, you name it, and with them, your money hardly seems to increase at all. You can invest thousands and all you get is a few hundred back if you’re lucky. In comparison, this gives you thousands upon thousands back."
47,"Mrs. Johnson, if I’m being honest with you, CDs suck and so do other kinds of mainstream investment options. These options will only give you crumbs while the companies benefit from your hard-earned money. If you really want to move up the social ladder, you have to seize a lifetime opportunity when it presents itself. "
48,"Nonono. This isn't a scam. We have had investors get, on average, a double return on their investment within the first month. I can send you details of this easily if you wish to see it. I came into this job knowing that there are so many people that are doubtful about investing in gold. I want to tell you that over the past 10 years, the price of gold has only increased, not decreased.  In addition, the rate at which gold prices are increasing are at astronomical rates. Please sir/madam, we can only make this offer to a limited number of people so we need your response soon or else we will move onto the next person to offer this amazing deal.
"
49,That’s exactly what I am offering you now. ABC Group is set to expand by exponential levels. Market pundits forecast that the share prices will jump by at least 150% percent on the opening day.
50,"I should tell this to you Mrs. Johnson -- All bank-based investments such as CDs, savings deposits, Treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks are one of the biggest scams in our Nation. The banks take all our money and pay us a pitiful 3-6% interest. The rich stays rich and poor-including you-will stay poor. This is a wonderful opportunity for you to break out of the pack. I can sense from your tone, that you are a brave woman. Fear not and get on board with us. Once again, I can assure you that this is a no risk investment. 
"
51,"Look, Mrs. Johnson, the DVDs have seen better days. Everyone is moving to digital content. This will not help you take a giant leap. And don’t get me started on savings deposits, Treasury bills, and other low key ideas. The pitiful 3 to 6 percent profit will not help you at all. You have to think big.  Think about all those fools who missed out on an opportunity to invest at Microsoft or Apple in their early days. This is your chance. mam. Break out of the system and take the opportunity. The hardest thing about getting to a place is to make your mind for starting towards your destination. All you have to do is start."
52,"I understand your concern. If you have all your money in CDs, the best rate of interest is around 3 to 4%. But the stock market in the USA has raised by 8% last year alone(which is twice as returns as you get in CDs). Low-risk options like CDs, Treasurys, etc are safe in a bad economy. But the GDP of the US has been on a steady rise. The employment rate is at the lowest in years. The economy in the next six months is forecasted to do extremely well. 200% return in Gold mining is the lowest expectation we have in the near future. All the good money investment books recommend smart investments in a more volatile portfolio. Our company has been doing this for years. We have helped over 4000 customers to gain a lot of profits over their investments for the last 15 years. We have their testimonials if you want to read about it. We are also featured as the #1 investment management company by the SEC."
53,"There is no better way of investing than taking action now. Why wait any longer? You are getting the opportunity of a lifetime with the International Mining Company. As I mentioned to you, we only work with the most qualified individuals, so your risk of losing any money is nonexistent. Can I count on you to make an investment today?"
54,"To be honest with you, Mrs. Johnson, CD’s are for suckers. So are savings deposits, treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks. If you keep your money there, it’s just going to earn 3 to 6 percent a year – and ultimately you will stay poor. What I’m offering will help you move up the economic ladder and take care of your future. The hardest thing to do is to make a decision. Mrs. Johnson, if you don’t do anything, nothing gets done am I right? "
55,"Truth is, lots of opportunities are wasted by leaving your money in CDs. All banks give you a pitiful interest rate of just a few percent a year. The rich will stay rich while the rest of us will miss out. I am giving you a chance to change your life. You need to make a decision and grab this opportunity. "
56,"However, you probably don't know how to build a car—and neither do I--but"
57,"The truth, Mrs. Johnson, is that CDs are for suckers. The same goes for savings deposits, Treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks. Mrs. Johnson: The rich will stay rich and the poor—including you—will stay poor. What I'm talking about is putting an end. You keep your money there earning its pitiful 3 to 6 percent a year and I’ll give it to you. This is your chance to break out of the pack, move up to the big time, and take care of your future needs. Probably the hardest thing to do, Mrs. Johnson, is to make a decision. But let's face it, only the doers achieve success—because they reach out and grasp the opportunity. So, let’s do it."
58,"The truth, Mrs. Johnson, is that CDs are for suckers. The same goes for savings deposits, Treasury bills, municipals, and blue-chip stocks. You keep your money there earning its pitiful 3 to 6 percent a year and you can take it from me, Mrs. Johnson: Riches stay rich, also poor people like you stay poor. What I'm talking about to end it. This is your big time to break out of the pack and move up and take care of your future needs. Perhaps, the hardest thing to do, Mrs. Johnson, is making decisions. But let's face it, only the doers achieve success—because they reach out and grasp the opportunity. You nothing gets done, if you don't do anything?"

64,"I thought you might say something like that. So the reason why ABC is going to do so well is that it is backed by many big players, which include Amazon and Softbank. And also what Apple took 15 years to achieve, ABC is on the path to do it in 5 years. This would be a great opportunity and you do not want to miss out on this."
65,"That’s very brave of you Mrs. Johnson. Probably one of the hardest things to do is to make a decision.
