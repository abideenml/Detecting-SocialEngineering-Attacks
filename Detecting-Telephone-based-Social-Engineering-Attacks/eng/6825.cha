*B:	um Typus this is the one that . 390440_392370
*A:	Tsk oh wait I also have one quest-. 392440_393550
*B:	There are . 392960_393190
*B:	there are two . 393300_394160
*B:	there are two problems that I've sort of been working on in . 394780_397300
*B:	you know in e- w-. 397490_398470
*B:	off and on &=breath . 398700_399650
*B:	um one is . 399800_401020
*B:	you have three schools . 401380_402820
*B:	exactly n people at each school . 403050_405180
*B:	each person at each school knows at least n@l plus one of two n@l
	people at the other schools. 405440_410460
*B:	Prove that there at least three people who all know each other
	knowing knowing is mutual. 410860_415220
*A:	That . 415950_416190
*A:	yeah . 416450_416750
*A:	oh you know who you should talk to about that one . 416900_418680
*B:	Dave? 420160_420600
*A:	No. 421190_421820
*B:	Who? 422820_423300
*A:	Let's see. 424080_424960
*A:	Who do we know that's into statistics. 425120_427470
*B:	Steve? 429010_429850
*B:	That's not statistics.
*B:	It's a combinatorical [: combinatorial] problem. 430180_432740
*A:	That's statistics. 433000_433990
*B:	There's a there is . 433310_434120
*B:	No. 435190_435820
*A:	Yes &um set set sets of n@l probability +/. 435920_439160
*B:	&=breath . 436170_436320
*A:	+, is probability and statistics.
*A:	Probabil-. 439470_440960
*B:	No no no.
*B:	It's not probability it . 440530_442450
*A:	No I know.
*A:	But . 442310_443120
*B:	prove that that it must . 442610_444550
*A:	It involves stati- i-. 444920_446110
*B:	Right.
*B:	But I I mean I've gotten I've . 445340_446970
*B:	like . 447150_447570
*B:	e- there &=laughs I tried I tried the simplest way to solve it and
	that . 447760_451720
*B:	that isn't . 451880_452350
*B:	that isn't enough. 452540_453700
*B:	&=breath And then I'm working on the second one which says
	something like &=breath . 453890_457210
*B:	okay . 457340_457830
*B:	at the first school you have n@l people who know n@l plus one . 459040_462260
*B:	people . 462370_462880
*B:	&=breath out of two n@l people. 463030_464350
*B:	That means that they know n@l squared plus n@l &=laughs &um of two
	n@l people. 464660_469430
*A:	<they're right yeah> [?] . 468320_468970
*A:	I I I it's not going to make any sense until I sit down with a
	pencil and paper and s-. 469330_472710
*B:	Like . 470140_470320
*B:	okay . 472420_472900
*B:	okay well . 473040_473770
*A:	That's the only way I understand maths is like . 473450_475460
*B:	okay. 475240_475690
*A:	I don't . 475910_476190
*B:	Sorry . 476180_476620
*A:	until I've worked on it . 476970_477920
*A:	I like . 478840_479310
*A:	No it depends on how complicated i-. 479840_480930
*B:	okay well I'll I'll send you e- if you want I'll send you these two
	questions that I'm working on. 480280_484850
*A:	yeah. 484700_485080
*A:	That would be good because . 485710_486480
*B:	Because . 485970_486520
*B:	because it's like . 486900_488030
*B:	e-. 488170_488310
*B:	e- they're they're w-. 488450_489530
*B:	they're not difficult problems &=breath . 489680_491710
*B:	And . 491920_492360
*B:	and I understand exactly what's happening in them. 493110_495240
*B:	um or I mean I understand plenty of what's happening.
*B:	I'msure there's there's a_lot more that I don't understand or else
	the solution would probably be really simple &=breath . 495760_503250
*B:	um . 503420_503980
*B:	xxx . 504740_505020
*B:	&=breath but i- it's it's really fun but really &=laughs . 505800_509020
*B:	but e- I wish it it were were going more quickly &=breath . 509160_511790
*B:	um . 511970_512419
*B:	But I I'm just . 513320_514640
*B:	I'm really really happy this person . 514770_516950
*B:	you know posted this list of things. 517229_519159
*B:	And the the really the really cool thing about it is &=breath . 519280_522460
*A:	yeah. 519360_519640
*B:	um . 522669_523260
*B:	like . 523580_523830
*B:	there are a_lot_of problems that . 524430_526210
*B:	like there are some problems that that because of the geometry
	center . 526620_530510
*B:	I was able to to . 530660_532020
*B:	like give answers to immediately. 532300_534210
*B:	&=breath . 534360_534610
*B:	And then there are others . 534770_536100
*A:	What happens if you cut a Moebius strip in half? 535230_537110
*B:	yeah. 537640_538250
*A:	Now what does happen?
*A:	E- I'm no- I'm not sure on that one.
*A:	I haven't . 538360_540710
*B:	D- do you did did you did you save that list someplace? 540330_543240
*A:	I have the . 543640_544350
*A:	um U R L. 544820_545570
*B:	&=breath okay. 546690_547410
*A:	xxx . 547350_547590
*B:	Because because e- what I could do with the problems that I'm
	working on is just . 547760_551090
*B:	give you the numbers if you +/. 551210_552500
*A:	yeah, let's see.
*A:	I'm trying to . 552500_553930
*B:	+, wanted to look at them. 552640_553620
*B:	That would I mean that would be easier. 554370_555800
*A:	Now . 556000_556230
*B:	But . 556280_556500
*A:	xxx . 557050_557340
*B:	I I actually I have stuff saved in a text xxx . 557380_560370
*A:	Would it be too simplistic to say you just get two Moebius strips?
	559810_562480
*B:	xxx huh? 564530_565140
*A:	I said if we're cutting the Moebius strip in . 565410_566990
*A:	in half . 568300_568720
*A:	wouldn't you just get two Moebius strips? 568940_570470
*B:	No, that's not what happens. 572290_573560
*A:	W- why not? 574830_575710
*B:	Cut a Moebius strip in half and you'll see. 575930_578090
*A:	But w-. 578130_578610
*A:	cut cut in half which way? 578860_579960
*B:	Lengthwise. 582860_583580
*A:	okay, yeah. 583980_584710
*A:	That I didn't . 584960_585590
*B:	Draw draw a line in the midde-. 585410_587550
*A:	oh wait never mind.
*A:	yeah.
*A:	That wouldn't work. 586960_588770
*B:	The the . 587850_588370
*B:	draw a line in the middle of the Moebius strip and cut . 588540_591370
*B:	along that line. 591530_592300
*A:	W- okay I . 593250_594680
*A:	Yes . 595140_595530
*A:	That's right.
*A:	I see what part of the problem would be then. 595780_597700
*B:	&=breath And and the thing that probably was the most humbling
	thing . 598610_603420
*B:	&=breath . 603550_603780
*B:	is you know the . 603930_604910
*B:	the description of . 605630_606660
*B:	of the xxx circle in Boston . 606730_608620
*A:	yeah I saw that. 609100_610080
*B:	um . 609500_609910
*A:	Eye to the eye. 610770_611590
*B:	yeah &=breath . 612690_613400
*B:	&=breath . 613920_614760
*A:	Wait . 614780_614970
*B:	ah &=breath . 614910_616040
*B:	&=breath and . 616130_617310
*A:	I don't know I I I've never dealt with imaginary xxx so I'm not
	sure. 616370_620210
*B:	yeah, I mean well it has to do with complex numbers.
*B:	And Igot . 620290_623910
*B:	When hen I get back I I . 624080_625840
*B:	I . 625990_626370
*B:	can try to explain it . 626500_627540
*B:	it to you because . 627760_628780
*B:	someone did explain it to me.
*B:	And i-. 629200_630930
*B:	i-. 631280_631710
*B:	&=breath I I don't completely understand it but I think . 633340_636070
*A:	Now I want to figure it out. 636640_637630
*B:	After going through xxx . 636820_638430
*A:	I I . 638050_638700
*A:	know enough about complex numbers that . 638880_640860
*A:	I theoretically should have a clue if I like . 641230_643690
*B:	okay, well I certainly I I &=breath . 643120_645420
*B:	maybe then then you can when I get back explain everything you know
	about complex numbers because . 645500_649960
*A:	It's been a long time. 650380_651290
*B:	um xxx . 650670_651330
*B:	Well &=breath . 652720_653420
*B:	between now and then you can figure it all out again. 653600_655950
*A:	Cool I'm really hoping whoever it was that hit my page in the
	geometry center liked it. 656590_660300
*A:	Like . 661990_662280
*A:	they were looking at it three times so . 663200_665350
*B:	Three times. 665930_666860
*A:	Yes. 666900_667330
*B:	How do you know it was the same person? 667950_669160
*A:	It was. 669440_669930
*A:	It was like three times like in a row so it was like you_know
	flipping back between pages. 670550_673710
*B:	That's really weird. 675660_676710
*B:	&=breath . 678410_678620
*B:	Well I mean this is this is when they're making decisions.
*B:	So &=breath it's entirely possible that you'll get a job at the
	geometry center and then I probably won't &=breath . 678740_686570
*B:	But . 686660_686940
*B:	you know . 687850_688340
*B:	that would be . 690140_690700
