*A:	huh. 412380_412570
*B:	But it might be a girl.
*B:	I was positive it was a girl. 412970_415970
*B:	Like the first three months, I was absolutely positive it was a
	girl. 416690_420540

*B:	oh we're not having an ultrasound. 431970_433690
*A:	uhhuh. 433660_433980
*B:	Because it's really like, . 434020_435290
*B:	We went and looked up all this research.

*B:	And, . 436180_440550
*A:	&=laughs . 440480_440930
*B:	If, if you want to know, just send me email.
*B:	Because I looked up a bunch of stuff, but, there's all this

*B:	It's not just amnio, it's like &=inhales other stuff too. 449660_452870
*A:	uhhuh. 452720_453250
*B:	And then there's also, um, . 453340_455000
*B:	you know, the, the, uh, the ultrasound.
*B:	But &=exhale in fact, like . 455870_459830
*B:	if you look at the l, the la-, the latest research on ultrasound,
	it's like, they really don't know. 460240_465200
*B:	&=inhales Like they assume that it's safe, because, you know,
	they've had it for twenty years, right. 465460_469910
*A:	And nothing has happened? 470220_471120
*B:	They never . 470400_470830
*B:	Ye-, well they don't know.
*B:	They've never really done any big studies on it or anything. 471530_475370
*B:	But the but if you're a normal, low, like there's reasons to have
	an ultrasound.
*B:	And if you have to have an ultrasound, then it's a really good
	diagnostic tool, right? 475930_484230
*A:	Right. 484150_484440
*B:	But in a normal low risk pregnancy like mine it's not a good
	diagnostic tool at all.
*B:	Like, . 484990_490790
*B:	is they find as many, um, false positives as they do false
	negatives. 491710_495850
*A:	For, for spina_bifida and stuff? 496090_498150
*B:	Well the only thing they can really check, they can check the
	heart. 498440_501080
*A:	uhhuh. 501470_501880
*B:	&=inhales And then they can check to see if the baby has a brain.
*B:	&=inhales And then they can do like . 501890_506320
*B:	yeah.
*B:	But then they can do some measurements to see if the baby has, um,
	. 507340_511060
*B:	ah . 512570_513099
*A:	Defects of various kinds. 512700_513930
*B:	Like Down's Syndrome.
*B:	Like sometimes y- But that's not really very good.
*B:	Like amnio is the only sure way to find out. 514210_520919
*A:	Right. 521030_521300
*B:	But it could give you like some indications that the baby might
	have Down's or something. 521250_524800
*B:	But it's really not a very good diagnostic tool at all for people
	with low risk pregnancies.
*B:	So, . 525420_529700
*A:	yeah. 530030_530280
*B:	&=inhales I didn't bother getting one. 530031_531260
*A:	yeah, good.
*A:	I'm sure everything will be fine &=laugh. 532140_534510
*B:	oh yeah. 534560_535270
*A:	And if it's not, it's like, you know, you're going to have to deal
	with it anyway. 535400_538670
*B:	Well what are you going to do I mean, if it's not, like &=inhale
	and we didn't do any of the testing because, like, . 537260_542010
*B:	I, I've met like three people since I got pregnant, where the baby
	had Down's, right.
*B:	They found out the baby had Down's. 542850_549250
*B:	And they aborted it.
*B:	They had, well, it's not called abortion, it's called termina-. 550120_553950
*A:	Termination, that's right. 553750_555330
*B:	And I jus-, I just couldn't have done that.
*B:	I just.
*B:	We talked about it a little bit, you know what I mean.
*B:	Like . 555390_560500
*B:	obviously I don't want my baby to have a mental defect or anything
	like that.
*B:	But . 560920_564810
*A:	But if it does, you'll deal with it. 564950_566570
*B:	I just could not have done that.
*B:	So it wasn't worth doing the prenatal testing.
*B:	Because, you know . 566080_571410
*A:	If you're not going to abort anyway, then there's no reason to have
	it. 572280_575190
*B:	yeah. 574310_574730
*B:	I mean there are like some, there are some conditions that they can
	test for that are sort of incompatible with life. 575660_581150
*A:	Right. 581750_582010
*B:	But then I figured, well, I'll just go through the nine months of
	pregnancy and then the baby will die when it's born.
*B:	You know. 581751_587720
*A:	If it's like that. 587730_588540
*B:	yeah. 588950_589200
*A:	yeah, we had this friend.
*A:	This is not supposed to scare you, it's just because it was on the
	topic.
*A:	But, um, but, the baby died at like eight and a half months. 589140_596420
*B:	mm. 591930_592130
*B:	I know.
*B:	I read so many of those stories.
