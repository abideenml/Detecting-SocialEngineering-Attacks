*B:	yeah, well &=breath Well . 151390_153110
*A:	I mean &um , I, I d-, I just think that it's largely because you're

*B:	I mean just . 173430_178410
*A:	I don't think it's like that &=distortion <sweetie I think you're
	overreacting> [?] [=! distorted]. 178700_181790
*B:	Well, I think e- the behavior indicates that, at least.
*B:	At lea- at least, you know, Mist, Mister Mister very sensitive and
	aware of other people's behavior is obviously not super aware of his
	own a little bit.
*B:	So. 180230_190190
*A:	&=distortion No you know that [=! distorted] . 183890_184980
*A:	Well, no, but you know that he acts abrupt like that anyway, right?

	rude that he didn't do that and all I get is this message blah, you
	know. 210190_215460
*A:	Well, you could, yeah, I mean I think it's valid for you to yell at
	him for standing you guys up and stuff.
*A:	And xxx . 215780_223110
*B:	Well it wasn't a- official plan, but, it's not as if he gave me a

*B:	I don't think so.
*B:	I was the one who suggested going out and doing something. 240220_243240
*A:	yeah. 243510_243800
*B:	The only thing he can be say put off by me is that my h- life hangs
	in the balance, and I &=breath would like to &=breath be left alone.
*B:	I don't think that that's unreasonable. 243620_251460
*A:	yeah. 251560_251980
*B:	You know, I e- you know, it's . 252140_253940

*A:	During this week or two, &=distortion or whatever [=! distorted] .
	262530_265890
*B:	The way I kind of see it is like if you want a a so- soft place to
	lie your head down and fall asleep, and wake up, y-, cook food or
	whatever . 264640_271790
*B:	and, putz around once in a while, that's fine.

*A:	eh, I mean, I get the impression not all of them can you go back to
	that place. 296730_303490
*A:	I mean have you ever actually talked to him about it. 305010_307220
*B:	No, but anyway. 307770_309060
*A:	Well, because, I, some of them, . 308960_311270
*A:	you know, it's . 312420_313050
*B:	oh, I understand, I think I understand what you were saying now. 313130_315400
*A:	yeah. 315340_315840
*B:	I think I figured it out that, . 315650_316920
*B:	yeah. 317490_318050
*A:	So he would like to have a place where eh they can come and visit
	him. 318240_323490
*B:	yeah . 323770_324090
*A:	And so, . 324380_325480
*A:	and so . 326300_326970
*B:	&=laughs . 328190_328780
*A:	It's fine with me . 328780_330320
*B:	Never mind, I thought about a hilarious word play.
*B:	But anyway, never mind. 329910_333320
*A:	&=laughs What? 332810_333650
*B:	I, I don't want to say. 334040_335260
*A:	&=laughs . 335340_336190
*B:	But that's it's not, it's not, it's, uh, it's a word play on what
	you just said, it's kind_of a switcheroony@n [: switcheroo], it's,
	but i-, i-, it, th-, it comes in it comes i- there's some truth to
	it, you know. 335740_345380
*A:	oh. 340130_340510
*A:	oh.
*A:	What's, what is it? 345580_347010

*A:	ah, ha, ha. 350810_352000
*B:	uh, &uh &=laugh.
*B:	Instead of coming and visiting. 351820_355020
*A:	yeah, well, okay &=laughs . 355600_358440
*B:	I just . 358880_359110
*A:	But, I I mean, anyway.
*A:	Anyway.
*A:	So, e-, my, my, my thought on the whole thing is that . 358920_365880
*A:	you know, if if you visited him, you wouldn't want to have to be .
	366470_370570
*A:	you know, spent panting and spending every second of the day, w-
	with him only.
*A:	You know what I'm saying and that . 371370_377540
*A:	probably part of the reason that it would be nice to actually stay
	with him is that you could also go and visit the sights or whatever
	and g- and . 378000_387180
*B:	Where?
*B:	What are you talking about? 386260_387560
*A:	In Japan. 387440_388190
*B:	I'm not going to Japan. 388150_389140

*A:	I'm trying to . 391030_392290
*B:	May-, maybe in ten years, but, no time soon &=laugh. 392250_394850
*A:	No, no, but, no, you know what I'm saying.
*A:	When you are visiting a town and you stay at someone's house and
	you can't ever do anything on your own and stuff like that.
*A:	So . 394640_405360
*B:	oh, I don't mind he does stuff on my e- his own.
*B:	I just uh, . 404890_407650
*B:	you know, I mean there's a difference between guests and there's a
	difference between ownership, I think.
*B:	I think that . 408260_413450
*A:	I know.
*A:	but . 413610_414520
*B:	There, I mean, if if if I live somewhere, you know, I can rearrange
	the furniture. 414120_418380
*A:	yeah. 418680_419120
*B:	But if I'm staying somewhere, it doesn't mean I'm I'm I'm in jail.
*B:	I mean just because I'm in a motel, doesn't mean I'm going to
	repaint the walls.
*B:	But it doesn't mean that I'm obligated to stay there either. 418800_427040
*A:	oh well I know but e- [=! yawning]. 426950_427960
*B:	I'm just saying there are different degrees of, you know I I, and I
	don't think he's obligated to sit there and hobnob around with me
	the entire time either.
*B:	I wouldn't want him to. 427750_435230
*A:	yeah. 435400_435840
*B:	You know I told him, I said I have no time to do anything.
*B:	And I I said I . 435710_438240
*A:	Well maybe that's why he was trying . 438210_440500
*B:	And as soon as as soon as I move back here, he's out. 440340_442820
*B:	I I I'm I'm to- totally insist on it.
*B:	I don't care if he never talks to me again. 443550_447370
*B:	Because, there's no way I can study with worrying about keeping
	somebody awake, or, you know, I have to worry how w-, how I'm
	dressed, if I'm clean.
*B:	You know.
*B:	Whatever. 447790_457140
*A:	yeah well, I I agree with that sweetie.
*A:	But, in that case, I think that while . 457270_462960
*B:	I mean he can stay while I'm at Erzhebat's, that's fine.
*B:	That's just . 462880_465230
*A:	Ex-, that was my point.
*A:	That was my whole point.
*A:	That . 464450_467230
*B:	yeah . 465710_465950
*B:	okay. 467270_467560
*A:	What is the big deal with just giving him a key and telling him to
	do what he wants.
*A:	And . 467690_471870
*B:	Well I have to go make a copy too &=breath &=tongue:clicks . 471370_473840
*A:	&=lipsmack Do you want me to, well.
*A:	Give him the keys and &=distortion . 474190_478240
*B:	You know what I'm saying.
*B:	And I'm kind of thinking about saying, well here's here give me a
	couple of bucks, I'll make a copy. 476460_480300
*A:	yeah, or just give him, just . 480680_482400
*A:	give him your set of keys one day when you're studying and say
	here, and bring it back.
*A:	You know, go make a copy and then bring it back.
*A:	And, . 483180_491770
*A:	I I mean I don't think it's that unreasonable for him to ask for a
	key when I, e- you know, at least I anyway, . 492340_498410
*B:	yeah. 493060_493410
*B:	yeah. 498240_498560
*A:	okay maybe not you, have offered long time ago that oh, yes, you
	can stay here and blahdeeblah@b. 498560_503640
*B:	yeah. 503640_504110
*A:	And j- he knows that you're not going to be there.
*A:	So I think that you know, I d- I don't think that it's unreasonable
	at all. 504030_511370
*B:	okay, yeah.
*B:	I just think he needs to know that there are limits.
*B:	Or whatever.
*B:	That I don't want it, I mean I'd like to be able to come here, . 510450_517130
*B:	during the day, anytime. 517640_519190
*B:	And not feel like if I need a book or something . 519590_522110
*A:	yeah . 519780_520090
*A:	uhhuh. 522320_522760
*B:	I don't want to feel restrained because it'll frustrate me . 522740_525180
*A:	uhhuh. 525390_525850
*B:	and I won't be able to concentrate. 525720_527190
*A:	Well, I think that that would be reasonable.
*A:	Just e-, make an agreement with him at what time you know, after
	what time of day will you call f- before you come over. 526690_536920
*B:	yeah. 536800_537070
*A:	You know?
*A:	Or, you know, so like, between, . 537320_540510
*A:	um, eight P M and . 540810_543200
*A:	you know ten A M . 543730_545160
*A:	I'll, if I c- have to come over then I'll call first. 545660_548810
*A:	Like that.
*A:	I mean I don't think that's unreasonable, you know?
*A:	Or something like that. 549630_553560
*B:	yeah. 553790_554060
*A:	Because then he can feel comfortable and you can feel comfortable
	because you know what's going on. 554650_561060
*B:	yeah. 561460_561860
*A:	You know. 562380_562910
*B:	yeah. 563240_563540
