*A:	&=lipsmack &=breath up-. 161620_162040
*A:	yeah.
*A:	I was just going to say Clinton just came out yesterday with his uh

*B:	uhhuh. 169900_170380
*A:	And, and basically he has in the past said that he was not in favor

*A:	you know of making &um al- allowances strictly based on race . 177580_182230
*A:	but at the same time &uh the analysis in the news . 182930_186490
*A:	&=breath shall we say the conservative analysis in the news is that
	. 186480_189980
*A:	Clinton just came out and said that he doesn't believe in quota
	systems . 190130_196020
*A:	and in reverse discrimination but that he does believe that
	affirmative action . 196550_201060
*A:	is necessary &=inhales to move &uh you know black Americans
	&=inhale . 201080_204970
*A:	forward and to give them the opportunities that they've been

*A:	So he's trying to, k- kind of walking a tight rope.
*A:	You know what I'm saying? 207780_210920
*B:	Right. 211450_211810

*A:	I think that he's . 218100_218960
*B:	Then he just ends up making nobody happy. 218870_220760
*A:	I think you're right &=laughs Because you know affirmative action
	is really under attack in the United States on, . 220680_226130
*A:	from many different quarters right now.
*A:	And, and it's a big, &=breath . 226200_229110
*A:	it's a big issue because it's supposed to be a gender, I mean not a
	gender a race . 229110_233850
*A:	uh color blind we're supposed to be race color blind and yet
	&=breath it's like contractors . 234460_239740
*A:	that are bidding you know with a high bid or higher than . 240200_243850
*A:	+, the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they
	are of ethnic protected you know black or whatever. 244130_251380
*A:	And it's really you know . 252050_252890
*B:	Right. 252520_252920
*A:	And then, then so they're taking lawsuits to the Supreme Court and
	all of this so it's &=breath . 253050_257820
*B:	Wow. 257630_258070
*A:	Another thing that just came up was that the Supreme Court said
	that the redistricting of the congressional districts one of which
	is in Georgia . 258280_267540
*A:	violated the Constitution because it was based primarily on race. 268540_274410
*A:	There was you know a new . 276260_277260
*B:	What did they do i- They were doing it because they were trying to
	make it more e- like they were trying to make it less segregated? 277000_283340
*A:	They were trying to make the district majority black Americans so
	therefore they drew it &uh all the way across the state. 284180_292310
*A:	You see what I'm saying? 292980_293700
*B:	oh right.
*B:	uhhuh. 293470_295190
*A:	a, a very narrow district and it created a majority black district
	which then elected . 294140_299690
*A:	a, a black representative and then it was challenged because it
	said well the only reason that it has been done this way is just to
	ensure that it was . 300190_307730
*A:	majority black &=inhales and that's not . 308200_310510
*B:	right . 310440_310840
*A:	you know . 311450_311810
*A:	Hello? 316370_316850
*B:	I'm here. 318190_318840
*A:	okay &=breath Anyway . 318800_319890
*B:	I'm mulling all this over. 319600_320950
*A:	yeah.
*A:	I mean it's, it . 321320_322210
*B:	So it's interesting because today we had a discussion with students
	about &um . 322070_325560
*B:	because we're doing a pre departure orientation so we were, we had
	our hot topics . 326040_329380
*B:	discussion today where we break in small groups and we talked about
	like political correctness . 329870_333760
*B:	and racial prejudice and sexual harrassment, feminism and . 333770_336820
*B:	just like different topics that they might encounter in America
	where the people have different attitudes than here in Russia. 337230_341550
*B:	So that was one of the things kind of like that &=distortion . 342520_344240
*B:	But I have I'm not really up on what the attitude is in America
	because I haven't been there in so long &=laughs . 345270_349140
*A:	Well there's a_lot_of frustration I think over the fact that
	there're, there're a number of evidences that the affirmative action
	. 349620_355860
*A:	program is in fact discriminating in the other direction and people
	are saying wait a minute.
*A:	Why don't we just give everybody &uh . 356500_363450
*A:	uh &uh an e- try to give everybody an equal shot and if someone
	feels that they've been discriminated against because of their race
	&=breath . 363620_369630
*A:	go at it from the standpoint of, of trying to remedy it through the
	courts &=breath . 369800_374000
*A:	rather than saying that government has to give X number of
	contracts to minority no matter what. 374060_379800
*B:	Right. 380760_381110
*A:	And as a result some &uh m- some people are getting contracts just
	because . 381410_386760
*A:	of the color of their skin and you know what I'm saying it's, it's,
	it's still . 387110_390690
*B:	When they might not even be the most qualified. 390210_392160
*A:	e- either them they're, they're not even, they're not the low bid .
	392310_395260
*A:	you know normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the
	quality spec- specification. 395590_400050
*B:	Right. 401050_401510
*A:	And but now you've, there have been several cases where clearly you
	know it was, . 401550_405670
*A:	they didn't get it because &=laughs they just didn't weren't the
	right color skin. 405810_409410
*A:	So now is that . 409790_410460
*B:	Right. 410190_410530
*A:	is that really remedying the situation or is it's creating a_lot_of
	uh of &uh resentment? 410780_416110
*A:	And &uh . 417000_417540
*B:	Right. 417230_417690
*A:	it's kind of too bad.
*A:	How long . 417820_418970
