*B:	yeah. 891380_891650
*A:	Because she doesn't think the quality of her work has changed.
*A:	Now I haven't submitted a conference paper with the Missouri . 895860_901490
*A:	um, you know, w- affiliation yet.

*B:	yeah.
*B:	&=laughs:breath . 922430_922890
*A:	but at any rate it was nice to hear from her because she said after

*B:	yeah. 932090_932420
*A:	she's accepted that there's a_lot_of good things in Rhode Island.

	has more time to be a parent. 932091_942180
*B:	yeah. 941010_941280
*B:	Good. 942950_943450

*A:	that fast each time. 970350_971940
*B:	mm. 971230_971420
*A:	um, and he says he went in and had some tests, and he was diagnosed
	as having attention deficit disorder.
*A:	Which . 972460_979470
*A:	you know, given how he's how far he's gotten, you know, he got his
	degree at Tufts and all, I found that surprising that for the first
	time as an adult they're diagnosing this.
*A:	um . 980180_989560
*B:	mm.
*B:	I wonder about it.
*B:	but anyway. 989420_991860
