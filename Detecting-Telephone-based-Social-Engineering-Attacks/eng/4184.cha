*A:	okay . 363710_364340
*A:	okay . 366260_366820

*A:	like people setups . 372910_374240
*B:	mhm. 375280_375700
*B:	yeah. 376680_377350
*A:	okay. 377560_378050

*B:	mhm. 402790_403630
*A:	um, and so I think that's better actually, so, if yo-, if you know,

*A:	just take all the pictures he needs to take actually before the
	ceremony itself. 408720_412000
*B:	mhm. 412230_412860
*B:	&=breath and what I would like to do . 413090_415260

*B:	mhm. 457470_457870
*B:	yeah.
*B:	no I do. 459370_460620

	you have to take several shots of each grouping and . 475390_480990
*B:	mhm . 478370_478800
*A:	all of that can take a considerable amount of time . 481540_483490
*B:	yeah . 484080_484430
