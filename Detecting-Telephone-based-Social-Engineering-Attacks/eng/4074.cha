*A:	So, anyway, how are you doing these days? 145150_147510
*B:	Things are going very well.
*B:	I think I had mentioned before that, um, that uh, that uh, that
	there's a company now that I'm working with . 147700_154910
*B:	um, uh, which is very much just, just myself and Guss. 155500_158710
*A:	oh. 159660_159910
*B:	And that &um . 159661_160740
*A:	No, you hadn't mentioned that. 161030_162050
*B:	eh, oh, okay.
*B:	okay, so &um . 161370_163630
*A:	eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at,
	and you were entertaining offers.
*A:	And, &uh . 163100_169250
*B:	Well i-, well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to, to
	just kind of set up my own company, of sorts.
*B:	So &um . 170130_176440
*A:	oh. 175710_176000
*B:	So things are going extremely well.
*B:	So, I had one client who said that he'd pay me a minimum amount.
*B:	You know, he'd, he, uh, there would be a minimum amount of work, of
	about uh, a day a week for the next two three years. 176520_188560
*A:	mhm. 188940_189300
*B:	Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then so I decided that it
	would make sense to do this.
*B:	And, &um . 188941_193930
*B:	and, um, I've been getting substantially more work than then. 194560_197690
*A:	mm. 197940_198300
*B:	So I'm quite pleased, quite pleased. 198970_200830
*A:	Well that's good. 201100_201870
*B:	So, um, so I have a bunch of &uh work that I need to do on my flat
	this year.
*B:	I've been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for
	quite some time.
*B:	But, it should, uh, it should come out this year. 202310_214010
*A:	oh, well that's good. 214260_215390
*B:	It should be done in a few months. 215390_216690
*A:	oh, yeah I remember . 217080_218300
*B:	&=lipsmack So . 217210_218090
*A:	you talking a little bit about it at one point. 218650_220950
*B:	yeah, yeah. 221060_221770
*B:	So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon? 222540_225420
*A:	um.
*A:	I don't see the finances occurring . 226010_229290
*B:	uhhuh, right. 229480_230100
*A:	for a while. 229600_230250
*A:	um, actually right at the moment finances are not going real well.
*A:	But . 231040_234760
*B:	ah well. 235250_235640
*A:	I am working on that one. 235270_236400
*A:	uh. 236980_237360
*A:	&=inhales It's just . 237900_238550
*B:	But &um . 238070_238670
*A:	uh, uh, the the the main reason for that is I had not really
	anticipated a few expenses that recently came up . 239130_246640
*B:	ah. 246990_247620
*A:	uh, related to a couple of burglaries that I had. 247010_250770
*B:	oh, harsh.
*B:	Harsh. 251130_252630
*A:	yeah.
*A:	yeah, but, and. 252280_255060
*A:	Not a whole lot I can do about that now. 255770_257400
*B:	Indeed.
*B:	Indeed. 257859_259010
*A:	have to deal with the situation.
*A:	And . 258709_260380
*A:	So that's what I'm doing. 261200_262160
*B:	Sounds good. 262750_263560
*A:	But &um . 262980_263610
*A:	Anyway, &uh . 265050_266030
*A:	One of the main reasons that I've been such a pathetic, uh,
	correspondent has been work. 266930_272760
*A:	I've actually been doing a_lot_of it. 273320_275390
*B:	oh wow. 276020_276620
*A:	And uh, I turned in my Master's thesis back in May, and I'm
	actually presently working on, um, . 276080_284320
*A:	several, uh, articles . 284800_286660
*B:	oh, okay.
*B:	Impressive xxx &=distortion. 287550_289210
*A:	from it. 288890_289100
*A:	yeah, actually it turns out that one thing, one little . 289920_293590
*A:	bit in what I was doing, uh, is going to turn out to be very
	important in the end. 294700_299340
*A:	And, uh, . 300090_300870
*A:	from what I had been reading in the literature.
*A:	You see the one very annoying thing about all of this, was my
	advisor has been in France for a year and a half. 302000_308810
*B:	yeah. 309270_309620
*A:	And this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know
	there wasn't much discussion. 309640_315270
*B:	yeah.
*B:	yup, yup. 315980_316900
*A:	But, &um . 316460_317730
*A:	Anyway, I had been . 319170_321030
*A:	kind of telling him that, you know, from my reading of the
	literature, I thought that this one little alteration I had made in
	my model was kind of clever and unique. 321890_332630
*B:	mhm. 333280_333620
*A:	And it f-, made . 333570_335450
*A:	w- the one type of solution occur, which . 336390_339840
*A:	was seen experimentally, but none of the other models had, uh, had?
	340550_345280
*B:	Yes. 345920_346510
*A:	They basically, the-, I I'm looking at, um, multi mode lasers.
*A:	And one of the . 346530_351730
*A:	things that they find experimentally are what they call anti
	phased, uh, states, where . 352240_358300
*A:	if you look at the total intensity . 359220_361240
*B:	uhhuh. 361830_362200
*A:	of the laser, you get . 361980_363520
*A:	an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency. 364090_367660
*B:	Yes.
*B:	okay. 368200_368960
*A:	If you look, i- if you separate out the different modes of the
	laser . 369350_373450
*B:	mhm. 374140_374560
*A:	and look at one of those, you get more than one frequency. 374141_378360
*B:	okay. 379280_379680
*A:	So what's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase
	so that they completely mask each other's . 379400_386220
*B:	Exactly.
*B:	hm. 386300_387390
*A:	oscillations on these other frequencies.
*A:	And . 386910_390060
*A:	uh . 390920_391300
*A:	you can . 392300_392800
*A:	With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency . 393450_398130
*A:	in a transient, but you can't find that frequency in a driven, uh,
	frequency . 398920_404480
*A:	You can't find so that it will sustain. 405070_406910
*B:	okay.
*B:	Yes. 407430_408240
*A:	So . 408270_408770
*A:	yeah, that that particular frequency according to most models . 409240_412720
*A:	damps out very quickly.
*A:	And so you shouldn't actually really be able to ever see it. 413160_417580
*B:	hm. 418320_418650
*A:	The only thing is, that, when you do the experiment you see it. 418740_422080
*B:	Got it, got it.
*B:	I see. 423040_424110
*A:	So, um, I found a . 424200_426620
*A:	simple modification of the original formula, which unfortunately
	makes the solutions horrendously nasty. 426970_433790
*A:	And in most cases, uh, insoluble. 434500_438390
*A:	But . 438960_439360
*B:	yeah. 438990_439260
*A:	it gives a driving term &=laughs . 440280_442480
*B:	oh, okay. 442940_443670
*A:	So, it actually &=laughs . 443180_444780
*A:	creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer, . 445490_448830
*A:	you just can't always write it down very easily. 449060_451500
*B:	Exactly. 451960_452590
*B:	oh wow.
*B:	So, so, so you, you-, you're pushing forward the bounds of
	theoretical laser . 453490_457890
*B:	laser, uh, whatever it is science. 458590_460580
*A:	But which, um, is kind of interesting considering that that's not
	really my thing. 460870_465860
*B:	&=laugh.
*B:	Indeed &=laughs.
*B:	Indeed. 466180_468870
*A:	Be- being an experimentalist, not a theorist.
*A:	But &um . 468580_471800
*B:	Indeed.
*B:	oh wow.
*B:	oh, impressive. 471780_473680
*A:	But . 474050_474240
*B:	So, so, so are, so are you going to get an article in Nature or
	something? 474180_477020
*A:	um, actually, . 477570_479430
*A:	I'm not sure if we're shooting for op-, I think . 480570_484800
*A:	Optics Letters is probably the one that we're shooting for, or
	else, perhaps, though . 485570_493200
*A:	I don't think it's quite that significant, would be Phys Rev
	Letters. 494450_497960
*B:	hm. 498610_498880
*A:	But, uh, we want to write a letter, and then a couple articles. 499490_504170
*B:	yeah.
*B:	hm.
*B:	xxx &=distorted impressive. 504730_506820
*A:	And . 506090_506780
*A:	I, I don't know how much you know about scientific literature, but
	letters are much more prestigious than, articles. 507780_513590
*B:	oh, okay.
*B:	oh, w-, I I didn't realize that.
*B:	okay. 514680_517110
*A:	yeah, so that that's why it's actually a big deal is . 516729_519860
*A:	I mean, you know, writing a couple of articles based on your
	Master's thesis, is, . 520190_523870
*A:	not at all unusual in Physics &=inhales and . 524210_528090
*B:	yeah. 527490_527740
*A:	uh, i- it's the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the
	impressive part of it all. 528440_534250
*A:	And what's actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that
	I thought that this was kind of significant. 534720_540150
*A:	And Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the
	thesis down that . 540990_547120
*B:	&=laughs . 547550_548120
*A:	people have been seeing th-.
*A:	You know, people see the anti phased motion, and it's true they do
	in the transients And . 547790_554740
*A:	I was having a_lot_of trouble getting across to him that all of the
	literature is in . 554810_558430
*A:	has this frequency in the transients . 559130_561560
*B:	Yes. 562230_562500
*A:	eh and not driven.
*A:	And, uh, what happened was after I had turned in my thesis . 562230_569480
*A:	but before I saw Neil again, he went to a conference in Rochester
	and &=inhales there . 570130_575810
*A:	this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work,
	was, . 576290_579540
*A:	that their models couldn't show this as a driven frequency, yet
	their experiments showed it . 580270_585610
*B:	&=laughs . 585880_587850
*A:	as a driven frequency. 585880_587220
*B:	oh cool. 587910_588520
*A:	And s- and so Neil . 587911_589290
*A:	then +/. 589920_590270
*B:	Said oh just a second I . 590310_591710
*A:	+, like a week later came to Bryn Mawr and he said, hey Lowell, we
	got to write this up &=laughs . 590630_595430
*B:	Exactly &=laugh. 595960_596880
*A:	And I was like, well I've been telling you that Neil &=laughs . 596540_598440
*B:	Indeed. 598840_599340
*A:	So . 600180_600530
*B:	Cool. 601580_601930
*A:	That's . 601910_602330
*B:	Cool. 602250_602580
*A:	that's mostly the sort of stuff that I'm spending a_lot_of time on
	now.
*A:	um . 602940_607450
*B:	Well it'll look good on your C V, your resume.
*B:	So &=breath so you might as well spend the time. 607430_611960
*A:	Yes, well, &=inhales uh, th- no, it's definitely worth doing.
*A:	um, . 613570_617730
*A:	and I would have been spending more time on it if it weren't for uh
	dealing with the burglary issues &=echo . 618260_623690
*B:	oh yeah but . 623480_624710
*A:	that I've been dealing with. 624010_625090
*B:	So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park. 625210_627550
*A:	Yes. 627680_628140
*B:	&=lipsmack yeah, okay.
*B:	yeah. 628600_629600
*A:	I mean the thing that i- this place is incredibly easy to break
	into if you want to. 630190_635220
*B:	oh. 630520_630840
*A:	It's not a question of whether or not, &uh . 636000_639070
*A:	you know, that, that was easy, it was just that no one really knew
	it was worth breaking into. 640070_645090
*B:	Exactly.
*B:	Exactly.
*B:	yeah. 645340_646870
*A:	And so the problem is that now they found out that it's worth
	breaking into. 646660_650420
*B:	yeah. 651170_651420
*A:	And unfortunate^ly .
*A:	Well, i- it's kind of odd.
*A:	They've stolen very weird things for the most part. 651440_658480
*B:	hm. 659150_659400
*A:	A- as far yeah as a.
*A:	The first time they broke in, they . 659340_663710
*A:	what they stole was just bizarre, mostly worthless . 664170_668270
*A:	stuff. 668910_669440
*A:	And, &uh . 670690_672070
*B:	huh . 671840_672090
*A:	the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they
	stole was the preamplifier of my stereo. 672450_680570
*A:	Unfortunately, because it's a nice preamplifier, it has an off
	board power supply which they didn't steal, . 681240_687810
*B:	&=breath . 688310_688930
*A:	which makes the thing that they stoled absolutely worthless. 688810_691880
*B:	huh &=laughing:breath. 692990_693720
*A:	So. 695850_696310
*B:	That's &=distortion bizarre.
*B:	Bizarre. 696370_697750
*B:	So, so so when they broke in the second time did they steal the uh,
	the &uh off board amplifier? 698650_702350
*A:	Actually, no, all they stole the second time was my bike. 702640_706090
*B:	huh. 707010_707350
*A:	Which was actually where the major problem came. 707350_710610
*B:	Exactly.
*B:	Exactly.
*B:	yeah. 710880_712420
*A:	Is that I suddenly had no transportation.
*A:	And so, . 711440_715290
*A:	I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike, and
	. 716140_719930
*B:	mm. 720470_720890
*A:	that that cost me a_lot_of time. 720471_722660
*B:	yeah.
*B:	Exactly. 723100_724060
*A:	Because, yes . 723101_724000
*A:	Spending a_lot_of time hunting for bikes, and . 724820_727140
*B:	nah well. 727970_728660
*A:	then getting one purchased, and then having to, . 728260_730680
*A:	you know, go get it and things like that.
*A:	But, . 731230_733450
*A:	that's dealt with at least.
*A:	And so . 734320_736030
*A:	uh, that's &=breath yeah . 737520_739590
*A:	at least dealt with.
*A:	Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this.
*A:	But . 740030_744960
*B:	yeah. 745240_745610
*A:	yeah.
*A:	At least . 745630_747100
*B:	Well that would make sense &=distortion . 746550_747720
*A:	during the summer I can actually, . 747660_750270
*A:	uh . 751130_751570
*A:	according to the stipulations of my grant, or my fellowship, I can
	actually earn money during the summer. 752280_758880
