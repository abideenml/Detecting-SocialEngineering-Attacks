*B:	um . 461420_462060

*A:	yeah. 489050_489330
*B:	But &uh . 489530_490070
*B:	You know I y- I knew when the list came out I didn't even have to
	look, you know, because I knew that both Barney and I were, um,
	eligible. 491420_499520
*A:	mhm . 499700_500010
*B:	Not in zone but eligible. 499960_501400
*A:	mhm. 501630_501920

	get together sometime. 585350_590680
*B:	&=laughs oh jeez. 591080_593560

*A:	All her old beaus are definitely losing it. 593350_597510
*A:	I think it prompted her to get married.
*A:	I'm trying to think if I've got any other news &=inhales . 598140_601170
