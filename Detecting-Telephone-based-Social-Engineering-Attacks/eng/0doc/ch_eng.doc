1.  Summary abstract

	The CallHome English corpus of telephone speech was collected
and transcribed by the Linguistic Data Consortium primarily in support
of the project on Large Vocabulary Conversational Speech Recognition
(LVCSR), sponsored by the U.S. Department of Defense.

	This release of the CallHome English corpus consists of 120
unscripted telephone conversations between native speakers of English.
The CD-ROM distribution contains the speech data only, along with
essential documentation files and software for handling the compressed
speech data.  The transcripts and other text data and documentation
are distributed separately (typically via electronic transmission from
the LDC's ftp/web server), and will be subject to periodic updates.
The transcripts cover a contiguous 5 or 10 minute segment (see section
2 below) taken from a recorded conversation lasting up to 30 minutes.
All speakers were aware that they were being recorded.  They were
given no guidelines concerning what they should talk about.  Once a
caller was recruited to participate, he/she was given a free choice of
whom to call.  Most participants called family members or close
friends overseas.  All calls originated in North America; 90 of the
120 calls were placed to various locations overseas, while the
remaining 30 were placed within North America.  The distribution of
call destinations can be found in the file "spkrinfo.tbl".

	The transcripts are timestamped by speaker turn for alignment
with the speech signal, and are provided in standard orthography.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Data acquisition

	Speakers were solicited by the LDC to participate in this
telephone speech collection effort via the internet, publications
(advertisements), and personal contacts.  A total of 200 call
originators were found, each of whom placed a telephone call via a
toll-free robot operator maintained by the LDC.  Access to the robot
operator was possible via a unique Personal Identification Number
(PIN) issued by the recruiting staff at the LDC when the caller
enrolled in the project.  The participants were made aware that their
telephone call would be recorded, as were the call recipients.  The
call was allowed only if both parties agreed to being recorded.  Each
caller was allowed to talk up to 30 minutes.  Upon successful
completion of the call, the caller was paid $20 (in addition to making
a free long-distance telephone call).  Each caller was allowed to
place only one telephone call.

	Although the goal of the call collection effort was to have
unique speakers in all calls, a handful of repeat speakers are
included in the corpus.  Specific information on this can be found in
the file "spkrinfo.doc".

	In all, 200 calls were transcribed.  Of these, 80 have been
designated as training calls, 20 as development test calls, and 100 as
evaluation test calls.  For each of the training and development test
calls, a contiguous 10-minute region was selected for transcription;
for the evaluation test calls, a 5-minute region was transcribed.  For
the present publication, only 20 of the evaluation test calls are
being released; the remaining 80 test calls are being held in reserve
for future LVCSR benchmark tests.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Data verification

	After a successful call was completed, a human audit of each
telephone call was conducted to verify that the proper language was
spoken, to check the quality of the recording, and to select and
describe the region to be transcribed.  The description of the
transcribed region provides information about channel quality, number
of speakers, their gender, and other attributes.  The information from
this audit may be found in the file "callinfo.tbl", and its contents
are described in greater detail in "callinfo.doc".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Speaker demographics

	Information on speaker demographics can be found in the file
spkrinfo.tbl, whose contents are described in the file spkrinfo.doc.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Data transcription - General

	All CallHome telephone conversations were transcribed using
the general conventions described below.  The finite set of
"non-lexemes" (hesitation sounds) used in the transcripts are provided
in section 6 below.

	The transcription was carried out on Sun 4 workstations.  The
transcription was done using the emacs text editor which was linked to
the visual and auditory soundwave from the telephone recording in an
xwaves window.  A program written at the LDC linked the xwaves signal
to the emacs buffer so that a highlighted region of the soundwave
could be brought into the emacs buffer as a timestamp via a simple
keystroke.  Similarly, the transcribers could listen to any timemarked
turn in the transcript, and view the aligned soundwave as well.  Thus,
the transcribers had a visual as well as auditory signal that they
were transcribing.  Both the visual and auditory signal were broken
into two separate channels that could be reviewed separately or
together.

	The transcribers were given the transcription conventions
provided below as a guideline how to transcribe the telephone
conversations.


               CALLHOME TRANSCRIPTION CONVENTIONS - General


What to transcribe:	10 contiguous minutes (600 seconds) from the
			recorded telephone conversations.  This should
			not include the beginning of the conversation
                        where the speakers are getting permission
                        for being recorded.
			

Definition of turns:    Separate turns are defined by the following
                        criteria:

                (1) speaker change, e.g.

                        A:  Well I was thinking about that

                        B:  I know I talked to &Jan about it yesterday

                (2) within one speaker's stretch of talk, a long
                turn should be broken up in terms of what makes
                grammatical/semantic sense, e.g.

                        A: And I told her %um I didn't I wasn't
                        setting you up to be a spiritual director or
                        anything {laugh} but I did say to her that if she
                        were to talk if she felt that she wanted to
                        talk about her prayer experience in Spanish

                        A: that you would probably be able to certainly
                        to understand her but to empathize a little bit
                        with what she was experiencing

                (3) If there is an extra-long pause within a
                single speaker's turn, break the turn up into two
                turns, e.g.

                        B: When we were fishing out on &Lake &Travis last
                        August I thought I saw, %uh [[long pause]]

                        B: %uh, &George &Martin, but I wasn't sure it was him.


Timestamps:             Each speaker turn is marked with a unique timestamp
                        (in seconds). The timestamps mark the beginning and
                        end time of each turn relative to the beginning of the
                        recording. Each timestamp is precise to the 100th of a
                        second, and is in the format: beginning time [space]
                        ending time, followed by the turn.
                        Some samples:

                27.98 28.72 A: You know so

                137.49 139.47 A: yeah {breath} (( )) [distortion]

                284.54 286.79 B: %ah &Lydia &Van &Damme.


Special Conventions:


    Acronyms            Acronyms pronounced like a word are written in all caps
                        with no spaces, e.g.

                        AIDS    NARAL

                        Acronyms pronounced like the individual letters are
                        written in all caps with spaces between the letters:

                        C I A           H I V           C E O

    Numbers             Write all numbers out, do not use digits

                        twenty-two      nineteen-ninety-five

    Interjections       Use the most standard spelling (as given on the
                        lexicon list, if it's there); don't try to
                        represent lengthening by writing multiple consonants
                        (like 'ooooh').

                        uh-huh  mhm   uh-oh   okay    jeez

    Punctuation		Transcribers are free to add any punctuation
			that they feel is helpful to someone reading
			the transcript.  


Special symbols:


    Noises, conversational phenomena, foreign words, etc. are marked
    with special symbols.  In the table below, "text" represents any
    word or descriptive phrase.

    {text}              sound made by the talker

                        {laugh} {cough} {sneeze} {breath}

    [text]              sound not made by the talker (background or channel)

                        [distortion]    [background noise]      [buzz]

    [/text]             end of continuous or intermittent sound not made by
                        the talker (beginning marked with previous [text])

    [[text]]            comment; most often used to describe unusual
                        characteristics of immediately preceding or following
                        speech (as opposed to separate noise event)

                        [[previous word lengthened]]    [[speaker is singing]]

    ((text))            unintelligible; text is best guess at transcription

                        ((coffee klatch))

    (( ))               unintelligible; can't even guess text

                        (( ))


    <language text>     speech in another language

                        <English going to California>

                        (simultaneous speech on different channels is not
                        explicitly marked, but is identifiable as such by
                        reference to time marks)

    //text//            aside (talker addressing someone in background)

                        //quit it, I'm talking to your sister!//

                        &Fiat           &Joe's &Grill


    text --             marks end of interrupted turn and continuation
    -- text             of same turn after interruption, e.g.

                        A: I saw &Joe yesterday coming out of --

                        B: You saw &Joe?!

                        A: -- the music store on &Seventeenth and &Chestnut.

6.  Data transcription - Non-lexemes

	For LVCSR purposes, some of the speech sounds uttered by the
conversational participants were deemed to be "non-lexemes" or
periodic sound sequences that are not listed as words in the
pronunciation dictionary.  The "non-lexemes" are distinct from the set
of interjections such as "okay" and "jeez" which are considered as words
in the lexicon.  The "non-lexemes" can loosely be considered as
hesitation sounds that a speaker makes while speaking.  While the
spelling of these sounds is somewhat arbitrary, the transcribers were
given a finite list from which to choose in order to maintain
orthographic consistency.  

	Below is the histogram of the token and frequency of non-lexemes
occurring in the 80 training and 20 devtest transcripts.

	1530 %uh
	1470 %um
	310 %eh
	309 %mm
	209 %hm
	194 %ah
	166 %huh
	15 %ha
	3 %er
	2 %oof
	2 %hee
	2 %ach
	1 %eee
	1 %ew

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Quality control (QC) procedures

	The creation of the transcripts was made in an iterative
manner.  The first step was to transcribe and timestamp the
appropriate portion of each conversation.  Once this was completed,
proper formatting and spelling was checked and corrected.  Once this
was completed, a second pass over all of the transcripts was made,
where both content and formatting was checked once more.  Throughout
this process, small improvements were constantly made and re-checked
for accuracy.  In most instances, a third (or even fourth) pass was
made over the transcript to verify its accuracy.  

Spelling: 

	As the telephone conversations were being transcribed, the
words found in the transcripts were being compiled for inclusion in
pronunciation dictionaries also being prepared by the LDC.  As the
lexicon workers compiled lists of words, they checked (among other
things) for spelling errors.  The lists of spelling/typo errors found
in the transcripts were compiled, and a program was run over the
transcripts to replace a misspelled word with its correct spelling.
Thus, work on the pronunciation dictionaries of the respective
languages helped to double-check the proper spelling of all words in
the transcripts.  

Syntax:  

	To check the well-formedness of the bracketing, a program was
written which goes over the transcripts and notes any apparent
irregularities.  This program was later adapted for on-line use by the
transcribers to be used while creating the transcripts.  A final
syntax check was run over all transcripts before the final release.

Timestamps:

	To check the well-formedness of timestamps, a program was
developed that checked for (1) overlapping timestamps, (2) start times
that are greater than end times, (3) turns that are missing
timestamps, (4) the proper formatting of a blank line before each
timestamp, (5) proper number of digits in each timestamp, and (6) the
proper marking of the speaker id.  This procedure was folded into the
syntax checking procedure to be used on-line by the transcribers.  

Content:

	To check that the properly spelled and formatted transcription
actually matched the spoken signal, a second human pass was made over
all of the transcripts.  In many instances, three or more passes were
made as well.
