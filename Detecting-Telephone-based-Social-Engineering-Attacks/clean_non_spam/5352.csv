209, um not since I ve spoken to him which has been like a week or two

213, I m happy 
214, yeah I think so 
215, That s a big step 
216, yeah I mean he s definitely like getting more into the looking for
217, a job mode kind of thing but 
218, oh he s been in it for awhile he s not ge he s been really into it
219, 
220, I was going to say like he s not one that I would ever doubt he

222, mhm 
223, Like he ll be successful he might just you know he ll work his
224, way distortion

231, If um if you talk to him 
232, message to him 
233, yeah 
234, xxx well uh I don t want to preach to him 
235, ut I definitely learned over here that 
236, eh before you get into marketing you have to first do sales 
237, yeah 
238, Not necessarily I have friends in New York doing advertising
239, marketing and 
240, they didn t do sales first but they had internships so distortion
241, xxx 
242, They had some kind of internship where they did sales or something
243, like that 
244, Had a advertising internship where I guess they kind of had their
245, own accounts 
246, Whatever but 
247, ut before marketing do sales okay laughs 
248, Even even even if they re doing some advertising thing they re not
249, 
250, They re not 
251, Probably the first thing they re doing is selling the
252, advertisements that s probably what you do your first year 
253, yeah the internship that I got offered was like basically it was um
254, 
255, Consulting but for an advertising firm like yeah go out there and 
256, 
257, Like it was like yeah 
258, Trying to sell the adver sales 
259, yeah 
260, Exactly before you can before you get into marketing yo you almost
261, always have to do sales 
262, So like we ll give you an account in a month or so but you know
263, this is what you have to do and they ll xxx you ll design in a
264, little while but 
265, xxx distortion without xxx 
266, yeah you you have to you have to earn your yeah breath you g I

270, mhm 
271, nd um 
272, nd I know like it was piddly piddly money and stuff but 
273, um I mean he could probably work and do a part time internship I
274, distortion 
275, I m not sure if he s in the position where he can actually 
276, Where he can work and do an internship part time 
277, Well I don t I don t know maybe he is but I I don t know I think he
278, needs more he he needs some money 
279, Like he w he s working a lot of hours at the golf course 
280, yeah that s what I m saying that this is the kind of thing where he
281, can fit in 
282, mhm maybe maybe 
283, xxx
