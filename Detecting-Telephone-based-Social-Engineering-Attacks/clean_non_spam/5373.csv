129, because well you said that you don t have um private it s all
130, public there isn t uh 
131, yeah there s no such thing as private here 
132, yeah so I had I 
133, paid for a private doctor and uh if I had private health insurance
134, I could ve had him but breath I paid for him and um 
135, uhhuh 
136, lipsmack he would just do most of my checkups towards the end
137, like he did it at twenty weeks and then like at twenty eight weeks
138, and then breath um as of about I think the last month 
139, I had to see him once a week breath now 
140, yeah 
141, I almost could ve bagged those visits and and it s a good thing he
142, came to Harvey ay he doesn t 
143, he doesn t come here anymore now that the the only obstetrician
144, that we have private obstetrician that we have in town is only in
145, Mayorborough and he s 
146, xxx 
147, okay 
148, which is a half hour away breath 
149, yeah 
150, and you basically just sit in the office and you come in and they
151, just take your blood pressure and they talk to you how you re going
152, and they might feel around the baby a little bit and there s no
153, internal exam of course and then that s it I mean I could go to my
154, doctor and do the same 
155, breath so I m a little bit torn as to how to go next time as far
156, as um a pri you know going private at at all 
157, yeah breath I would be so much different if I had a baby again I
158, mean well we do plan actually on having more than one but uh 
159, yeah 
160, You know I I just I mean I just thought it would be so different I
161, mean I I find that I don t need to see the doctor I have no desire
162, to see the doctor you know 
163, breath yeah y you sort of you get you get a bit afraid you know
164, like I I was quite re you know I was always good with my visits and
165, did my visits and and I sort of realized that 
166, and I thought I would 
167, yeah

169, because oh no I did one follow up 
170, uhhuh 
171, breath but I d I had to do another one I just didn t show up for
