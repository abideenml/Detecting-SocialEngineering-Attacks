,0
0,okay but he s had w he s several heart attacks and things 
1, He s had several heart attacks 
2, So I mean you just don t well I don t know 
3, I don t know I mean 
4, yeah the idea of him having a heart attack at the wheel 
5, Well you think he I mean he is basically I would say like a sort of
6, a pr I w I don t know if you would call it a professional driver 
7, 
8, yeah yeah 
9, Certainly a good long term driver 
10, Right right 
11, nd I distortion think be 
12, Still that s true 
13, he is I I sti I think I would trust his judgment uh of feeling
14, that he s capable of driving or not 
15, mhm 
16, mm mm yeah except you know he s so independent 
17, yeah yeah 
18, I don t know I mean you know maybe he ll be fine I mean I just know
19, that our grandfather you know grand um 
20, grandpa Harris died 
21, somehow distortion 
22, you know of a heart attack at the steering wheel 
23, look and that could happen to someone that s forty also 
24, yeah yeah I mean yeah that is true but you know when you ha you re
25, older and you have a history of heart attacks and strokes
26, distortion 
27, yeah but it I mean in Israel the majority of the car accidents I
28, think are you know 
29, drunken driving you know or dangerous passing and that sort of
30, stuff and 
31, yeah yeah 
32, yeah uhhuh 
33, gee 
34, um how are your headaches 
35, xxx 
36, um the headaches themselves actually are gone the only thing 
37, good 
38, um 
39, The only thing that s left is that there s still sometimes the
40, dizziness 
41, mm hm 
42, when I m sort of moving my head back and forth or or looking at
43, something and from side to side 
44, mhm 
45, mhm mhm 
46, I ve got the appointment the 
47, right that s the day that Miriam comes 
48, I still feel kind of funny you know go you know I thought do I
49, really need it but I 
50, yeah you do 
51, I should distorted 
52, I mean 
53, you know 
54, you know if they distortion think you should have it 
55, you know it seems like xxx distortion that you know I should 
56, you know finish the check thing out distortion 
57, right right 
58, have they checked just like inner ear stuff 
59, No they actually haven t I ve got to talk to the doc about that
60, again 
61, ecause that I mean is one of the more obvious 
62, sort of sources of of dizziness type of things 
63, yeah 
64, breath well I guess probably maybe the reason they didn t check
65, it because my original complaint was 
66, because the headache 
67, was the headaches and not the dizziness the dizziness was added
68, on later 
69, yeah 
70, yeah 
71, yeah breath there was this um 
72, I mean I don t think I mean your symptoms probably aren t it but I
73, mean one of the most miserable things that I ever had and I ve
74, completely forgotten the name of it 
75, but 
76, You can get this incredible disease I mean the whole and it s it s
77, a viral thing 
78, um no it was a bacterial thing that happened after a viral thing 
79, 
80, but they have some medicine for it where literally the world was
81, spinning around 
82, oh I think I heard something ab 
83, and it was 
84, It was so awful I mean it was just uh 
85, but I mean that was completely ears like the aftermath of an ear s 
86, you know somehow 
87, you know bacteria ended up in the inner ear and instead of getting
88, an ear infection I got this dizziness from it 
89, xxx 
90, mhm distortion 
91, hm 
92, but distortion 
93, um 
94, but I mean that is where your you know like balance center is and
95, stuff and 
96, yeah distorted 
97, you know it might be worth them checking 
98, xxx 
99, but breath um 
100, has vnir had more you know thoughts about I mean is he just going
101, to wait and see with the kibbutz s yid or I mean factory or 
102, I don t know I mean we haven t really sat down really discussed it
103, that 
104, yeah 
105, you know 
106, serious I m still waiting and seeing you know 
107, yeah yeah 
108, how things go 
109, I guess the hard thing is that how will you know when you know how
110, things are going laughing 
111, yeah yeah 
112, I mean if that makes any sense 
113, yeah well I mean I think I I assume it s going to be getting worse
114, 
115, more so even in a little while because uh 
116, this one guy xxx who was like a a fresh br breeze blown through
117, the factory uh uh uh 
118, twenty four twenty five year old guy 
119, oh yeah you mentioned him 
120, yeah well he starts studies in the Technion on Tuesday 
121, mm mm 
122, that s it he s done 
123, hm 
124, nd eh I m sure if there was xxx distorted 
125, he maybe maybe Miriam should meet him laughs 
126, laughs he has a serious girlfriend has distortion for a few
127, years 
128, uh oh okay laughing laughs 
129, yeah distorted 
130, huh 
131, um 
132, but uh I m thinking it was definitely going to be worse when he s
133, not around 
134, yeah yeah right 
135, hm 
136, oh tell me what are what are the um leads that uh Miriam has what
137, um 
138, well she had her final thing and they found it encouraging there
139, were two things through Shatil 
140, mhm 
141, um but I m not sure 
142, you know what they were called one may be ca Ray ut or something 
143, 
144, I heard of Ray ut yeah 
145, that was one of them I don t know the other one um one may have
146, been not 
147, n not sort of Jewish 
148, uh and rab but just rab 
149, because I remember them saying something in a letter to her what 
150, 
151, xxx 
152, and but it was in the Galilee I mean saying what a good thing 
153, it could be 
154, for a Jewish person to be 
155, you know in a circumstance like this 
156, so that they would realize that Jews actually you know have an
157, interest 
158, mm 
159, uhhuh 
160, in in and I think that was something involving kids but I m not
161, sure it may be teenagers 
162, mhm 
163, mhm 
164, um and then the other one I think and I don t know if the other one
165, was Ray ut or not I think that was the one that had to do with 
166, um 
167, a daycare center which is for both 
168, um it sounded actually very breath like it would be very hard but
169, 
170, a daycare center for Jewish and rab kids and it was outside of 
171, either 
172, Haifa or Tel viv I don t remember which one breath but the
173, problem is 
174, mhm 
175, there were kids from 
176, really troubled homes and it s like 
177, iffy 
178, it was very intensive daycare 
179, to avoid them being put in foster care 
180, oh wow 
181, so you have eh and but the second goal of the 
182, thing is to increase 
183, sort of coexistence 
184, mhm 
185, you know among these groups 
186, and Miriam is more interested in the second goal and I mean the
187, first goal I mean it s something I think 
188, she could be interested in but I think emotionally it could be so
189, hard because these are not going to be your 
190, yeah 
191, you know your sort of average cute cheery 
192, yes 
193, you know three year old 
194, right 
195, um you know they may be abused they may be you know who knows what
196, 
197, yeah 
198, um but I think there are other possibilities too and I think 
199, xxx 
200, um you know what they said basically to her and they sounded very
201, positive I mean I looked at some of the letters or emails that she
202, had gotten from them 
203, xxx distortion 
204, they sounded really positive and like they were sure they would
205, find something for her it s just that they don t make 
206, any permanent assignments until the 
207, person meets with the people from that group 
208, wait th I mean wh where so when she comes arrives what does she
209, has to do what s the 
210, Well she s going to at some point I mean she ll have to be in
211, contact more with these people in Shatil and I guess set up some
212, meetings with these groups that they think might 
213, Where is Shatil do you know 
214, xxx 
215, no I don t know where they are headquartered breath 
216, mhm 
217, um it might be Jerusalem but I m not sure 
218, mhm 
219, um but you know they re like sort of a coordinator or or an
220, umbrella organization or something 
221, yeah 
222, um 
223, distortion xxx 
224, xxx as soon as she gets in the first thing is to immediately try to
225, make phone calls 
226, breath I mean I ve got a r a a room for her on the kibbutz s yid
227, 
228, for two or three weeks 
229, mhm mhm 
230, I could probably extend it look it she could also stay on our couch
231, but if not or she could als 
232, mhm mhm 
233, xxx not as convenient but you know 
234, yeah well I mean I think she d like to arrange things you know
235, pretty much as soon as she can I mean I think she ll need a few days
236, just to unwind laughs 
237, oh yeah 
238, yeah 
239, exactly yeah 
240, but um but then I think she wants to get 
241, working on it and and some of them talk t some of these
242, opportunities I mean they faxed her a bunch of stuff alre or
243, emailed her a bunch of stuff 
244, that some of these things 
245, provide housing in an absorption center some provide 
246, housing in a village which I told her to be real careful if that s
247, a traditional rab village I don t think she wants to stay there I
248, mean live there 
249, I mean I think it would make it very hard for her to have a social
250, life 
251, mm distortion 
252, yeah that s true too 
253, I mean you know like after eight o clock she couldn t be out and
254, she couldn t be seen with a man who was not you know laughing 
255, her her blood relative or something 
256, well she s got to check not all villages are like that 
257, well that s true that s true 
258, breath I mean I know the I know the one that do you remember
259, Lowai 
260, some of them xxx 
261, yeah 
262, I mean his village apparently was quite traditional 
263, mhm 
264, um xxx but maybe you know 
265, I wonder if she ll be allowed to visit Lowai this time
266, laughing 
267, Well you know he would not visit her the last time because he was
268, engaged 
269, I remember that 
270, If he s married now maybe he can I don t know 
271, I yeah 
272, or maybe with his wife he could 
273, Look it xxx one thing is for sure is like if she s what what I m
274, sort of guessing 
275, is that 
276, l um Daka is very close to where David lives it s like a half an
277, hour away f 
278, oh I didn t know that huh 
279, yeah 
280, maybe forty minutes something like that 
281, uhhuh 
282, I would guess an and David has a lot of friends there 
283, mm 
284, in akaldorbia 
285, mm 
286, and some people he works with 
287, oh wow 
288, I m guessing distorted is that if 
289, sh you know if if it doesn t work otherwise 
290, with David 
291, mhm 
292, they could probably go together and visit you know to you know
293, when it s a when she s com not coming the female on her own 
294, mhm mhm right 
295, but coming distortion with her cousin or male cousin I m I m
296, guessing that s sort of the you know that 
297, oh I think that would probably be fine yeah 
298, yeah 
299, I mean it s just like unchaperoned is the problem laughs 
300, It s something like that I m guessing you know I 
301, yeah yeah 
302, put things distorted try to make things easier 
303, huh 
304, or maybe even go with David to to his friend in some virkohl s heb
305, that you know we re in Daka visiting someone else you know can we
306, come and say hello xxx you know it s like 
307, mhm 
308, mhm 
309, yeah 
310, yeah I mean I think she would really like to see him and you know
311, he was really very sweet and 
312, yeah 
313, you know it was sort of one these things that she sort of felt like
314, she came up against the cultural wall I mean she sort of understood
315, but breath 
316, I guess intellectually understood but emotionally didn t understand
317, laughs 
318, yeah 
319, um which I think you know she ll probably have a lot of those kinds
320, of experiences 
321, yeah xxx have um 
322, um 
323, but did she send boxes 
324, um yes just 
325, three 
326, mhm 
327, um by boat mail you know surface mail 
328, she sent what xxx to her care of me or how s distortion 
329, yes yes 
330, one is books and the others are used clothes 
331, oh 
332, mhm 
333, mhm 
334, So I mean I don t whatever I don t know whatever forms 
335, you know she had to fill out for it but she didn t 
336, the right things and there s breath there s nothing new in there
337, so I mean it shouldn t be and it s to herself that shouldn t be a
338, customs issue 
339, shouldn t be a problem now under what visa is she coming 
340, pardon 
341, Did she get any special visa or just whatever 
342, No I think they said I mean she talked to them and whatever I mean
343, she did whatever they told her first 
344, oh oh I no I think she talked to the consulate first they said yes
345, she needed one and then they said no she actually could get one in
346, Israel 
347, uhhuh 
348, uhhuh 
349, um so she just listened to what I mean she d gotten to know the
350, shuliach s heb in um lipsmack 
351, um 
352, tlanta distorted ah no in Michigan distortion 
353, in um Michigan 
354, Chicago or whatever distorted 
355, and and talked with them 
356, talked with him some and just did whatever he ended up saying 
357, mhm 
358, um and laughing she called me poor Miriam called me 
359, yesterday morning I mean she had had a great time she hadn t called
360, and I didn t 
361, Is she in Spain distorted already 
362, Well yes now she is breath but 
363, I ve been watching the weather France it looks like she had very
364, nice warm weather in France the whole time 
365, yeah I think so I mean she just spoke very very briefly but she
366, said she had a really nice time 
367, but she decided um her friend didn t have time to meet her in the
368, mountains of Spain and she was going to go right to Madrid 
369, it was going to be an all night 
370, xxx 
371, um train ride breath and then she found out plane costs the
372, same thing so she decided to go by plane but she called me breath
373, 
374, very distraught from the airport because I told her it was going to
375, be two hundred dollars for her 
376, extra for her luggage because within Europe I mean everybody had
377, told her like if you she flew directly to Israel from 
378, the States 
379, she was allowed seventy kilos because she was stopping in Europe
380, she was only allowed forty kilos 
381, right 
382, then they told her within Europe it was only twenty five kilos 
383, right 
384, so she was like or twenty kilos she was like twenty kilos over and
385, 
386, and I just didn t know what to tell her to do I mean laughs you
387, know I mean she hadn t originally planned to fly 
388, oy 
389, you know just I guess it has to do with like this common market
390, stuff now or whatever but 
391, End
392,
