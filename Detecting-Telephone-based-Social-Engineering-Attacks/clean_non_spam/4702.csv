236, yeah does he play mostly soprano or what 
237, He s plays everything 
238, He plays alto and eh 
239, Well yeah because inhales see every time I have a soloist like
240, Conti and with Charlie Mariano clears throat I figure out which
241, arrangements they re going to play on and I write out all their
242, chords and where to come in and everything 
243, mhm 
244, and I send them a cassette so that when they get here you know
245, with Conti we didn t even have time for a re one rehearsal not even
246, 
247, mhm 
248, With Charlie we did cough so this helps a lot 
249, You want to kn you want me to ask Ray what he s going to be
250, playing 
251, uh well uh did you say he wrote me a letter 
252, yeah 
253, ecause I m I m getting uh ready to contact him I ve been so damn
254, busy man and right now I m uh 
255, working on music now yeah if you happen to see him ask him if he
256, prefers soprano or alto 
257, or okay 
258, because that way I have to know what key to write the solos in 
259, yeah okay I ll ask him nex because we re working together on
