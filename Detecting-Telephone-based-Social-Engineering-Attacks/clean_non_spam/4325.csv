74, oh 
75, Now I have like two days left 
76, uhhuh 
77, Like sixteen hours which was going to cover me for at least a
78, couple days in ugust so I wouldn t like go without a check inhale
79, 
80, yeah 
81, but they told me they had to pay me that sixteen hours of vacation
82, time 
83, huh 
84, which is mandatory which I think stinks 
85, yeah 
86, You know 
87, hm 
88, but I just can t wait to get back to work and 
89, ack to normal 
90, yeah 
91, laughs 
92, and I like taking courses and I really like it but I don t like
93, taking summer courses not like two at a time 
94, yeah 
95, It s so crammed in 
96, mhm 
97, for five weeks 
98, yeah because we do t and we do like two chapters we have to study
99, for tomorrow and I only read one thoroughly and the other one I m
100, going to read and learn 
101, so I ve got to go to the library and ba basically box myself in
102, like in one of those little cubicles and just read it and and learn
103, it that way 
104, mhm 
105, ecause I can t really concentrate unless I m lipsmack totally
106, away from things 
107, yeah 
108, Like I m home and the T V is on in the other room I can hear it 
109, Right 
110, I need to be totally isolated and have just everything block
111, everything out 
112, mhm 
113, clears throat That s the only way I can study 
114, yeah 
115, I mean I can t even study if I m with Patrick 
116, because I ll sit I ll read stuff 
117, yeah 
118, like I can read a book but I can t like study and because I don t I
119, can t block everything out 
120, yeah 
121, so 
122, So you guys are still seeing each other 
123, yeah it s it s weird because um couple days after I wrote you Mal
124, was really bummed out 
125, yeah 
126, lipsmack nd we talked and stuff and um I mean I told I miss him
127, and me I was crying on the phone 
128, He was crying on the phone 
129, mhm 
130, ecause I said are you going to miss me 
131, He said well I miss you already and it was like you know why we
132, doing this then 
133, yeah 
134, So I figured we d um 
135, take more time give him some more time and like evaluate in like
136, six months like in October 
137, mhm 
138, So we ve been seeing each other up until and you know we still have
139, been seeing each other but I don t like go to family things of his 
140, 
141, mhm 
142, which is kind of weird and I m like I wrote him a letter over this
143, past week and told him 
144, how this is not enough you know I said it s you knew this was
145, going to happen at some point you have to make a decision either you
146, want us to be together or you don t 
147, yeah 
148, you know my feelings and 
149, that s just the way it has to be lipsmack I said this isn t
150, like it s a new relationship 
151, We ve known each other for ten years and we ve gone through the
152, good bad and the ugly 
153, yeah 
154, and we were still here because we love each other so that should
155, mean something or that should show you 
156, you know that shou that should be significant somehow 
157, mhm 
158, lipsmack I think it is but inhales um we re going to talk
159, about some stuff on Friday and then we re spending the day together
160, Sunday 
161, Is he working now 
162, No in fact he got laid off 
163, Did you know that 
164, I think I think h 
165, I m not sure if he got laid off and was laid off when grandma died 
166, I think he was 
167, yeah 
168, I think he was 
169, but um h 
170, but he was going to I don t know he was going to do something 
171, Was he going to go to 
172, He had gotten some money for school 
173, yeah 
174, so he took um English Comp which he got a an minus in I believe
175, because he really he s a really good writer 
176, uhhuh 
177, and he really writes from his soul breath um and he s taking of
178, all things natomy and Physiology which is the toughest thing he
179, could take and 
180, yeah I know laughs I don t ever want to I don t ever want to take
181, that 
182, and he s having a hard time with it but he s busting his butt I
183, mean he s he s done some work and has gotten some really good grades
184, and some just mediocre grades 
185, so he s take he wanted to prove to himself that he could do it so
186, he took the hardest thing he had to take forever 
187, Next time he ll just be doing the and P of the um alcohol
188, abusive person 
189, mhm 
190, So he told me today he just got his test back he thought he did
191, really well but he got a sixty eight and he s so ticked because he
192, made some careless errors he 
193, skipped one question and went on to the next but when he wrote th 
194, the um the letters in 
195, he put it on that particular one and then when he answered the
196, other questions the other three were just off because they weren t
197, in the right spot 
198, oh 
199, mhm 
200, lipsmack t the last four which were right which he would have
201, had credit for were wrong because he put them on the wrong space 
202, Right 
203, Right 
204, and he was really ticked off at himself 
205, Did is that passing 
206, yeah sixty eight is passing I mean a D is passing 
207, yeah well see it there s different scales that people have 
208, clears throat mhm 
209, for grades 
210, yeah 
211, and sometimes uh tha tha you know like a I don t know I don t
212, remember how it goes but 
213, It s passing but for some particular programs you have to have at
214, least a C or better 
215, mhm 
216, breath So I was lucky I got a in English Lit but that was like
217, the first time I wrote a paper in like eight years 
218, Was that an interesting class 
219, I liked it yeah 
220, I didn t like the poetry 
221, mhm 
222, and having to analyze poetry but I liked English Literature I liked
223, analyzing the stories 
224, yeah 
225, I enjoyed that part and that part once I got the hang of it was
226, okay 
227, yeah 
228, and my first paper I got a C on and I d knew the story really well 
229, It was intelligently written but I didn t like dig into it 
230, mhm 
231, and the second paper I got a minus and then and I never really
232, liked the author of that story either 
233, I didn t really understand the story so well 
234, yeah 
235, Called The Misfit 
236, I didn t like the author Flanner O Connery 
237, oh 
238, I ve heard of him 
239, but I ve never read anything 
240, um and th the third one we did is Hamlet which I loved 
241, I love Shakespeare 
242, hm 
243, So I had to write a paper on Hamlet 
244, Shakespeare s hard to understand I think 
245, It is 
246, laughs 
247, because you have to keep going down to the footnotes and like 
248, coughs 
249, learning what the words mean and stuff 
250, mhm 
251, but we also watched the film I got th the tape the movie with Mel
252, Gibson and 
253, oh 
254, I watched that 
255, yeah 
256, and I really enjoy that kind of thing 
257, mhm 
258, so I wrote a good paper I made up my my little poem at the end of
259, it laugh 
260, laughs 
261, and I got a plus and I because I really I added more to it you
262, know 
263, yeah 
264, It was really it was really well done I really and inhales that
265, was the easiest paper for me to write I don t know if it was because
266, I had done two before that or if I just really enjoyed the material
267, I was working with 
268, yeah that helps laugh 
269, but I got a really good grade on that and I got a on the course
270, but I worked really hard for it and it wasn t easy 
271, yeah 
272, You know and then breath for Psych and Soc I got three s on my
273, test for Psychology I m taking one next tomorrow and then one on um
274, next Wednesday that ll be my final grade 
275, yeah 
276, nd then for my midterm on Soc Sociology I got an

290, Do you know what those are 
291, What are they 
292, Tele courses 
293, It s like you you get a video

295, and you just you know watch the video at home 
296, mhm 
297, and you do your own the reading and the the work and stuff at home
298, and then you go in however so often they have a schedule set up to
299, the school and take your test 
300, oh really 
301, It s like in a testing s center 
302, uhhuh 
303, Wow 
304, nd I m I m going to try that since I took you know a lot of French
305, in High School 
306, yeah 
307, I thought maybe it won t be too hard 
308, huh 
309, to do it that way I m going to try and take it 
310, that would be interesting 
311, yeah 
312, inhales because we did a um 
313, we ll see laughs 
314, study evaluation on us 
315, We had to write down on Psychology and inhales it turned out that
316, I m a I m a what do you call it 
317, lipsmack something observer 
318, reflective observer when I study 
319, mhm 
320, When I do things like kind of like like sit back and watch the
321, stuff and I 
322, yeah 
323, I could be very quiet in the class 
324, I don t really participate a lot in the class 
325, when I pay attention I m always there 
326, mhm 
327, but I don t like say a lot of stuff 
328, yeah 
329, Not in the Psychology class I don t 
330, I just don t feel comfortable with it like with the people that are
331, in there 
332, yeah 
333, so I just I listen so I know everything I comp I comprehend
334, everything I know it but breath 
335, Is there younger students in 
336, clears throat 
337, or just are they mostly adults or 
338, There s um there s a mix 
339, There some high sch not high school kids like nineteen twenty year
340, old 
341, yeah 
342, and there s some married women in there an older woman 
343, mhm 
344, and then younger kids 
345, There s a couple black people in there 
346, yeah that sounds about 
347, You know it s it s a good mix 
348, like what it is here yeah 
349, but it seems like this kid who I m not saying oh I hope I m not
350, being prejudice but he s black and he s like always questioning the
351, teachers and stuff and he thinks like 
352, well if your father you know if that s if you were told that you
353, were brought up in a house you do what he says you know that s
354, breath 
355, that s okay to learn that and stuff and that s okay to do to your
356, kid and she s trying to teach him that it s not okay to do that
357, breath 
358, mhm 
359, that s not how you build someone self respect and to do things like
360, that and breath it s like a couple people like to argue with her
361, and like 
362, laughs 
363, they think teachers are really ignorant and stupid you know 
364, well she got to be the teacher she must have done something
365, laughs 
366, xxx but xxx distortion clears throat yeah 
367, So um but it s it s good I mean it s been interesting 
368, They had a hypnotist come in the other day inhales but I didn t
369, want to do it just because I wasn t very I was skeptical of it and
370, not really um enthusiastic about it 
371, yeah 
372, I didn t feel comfortable like I wa I was more interested in
373, watching people around me 
374, mhm 
375, like see if they really kind of like really got into it and 
376, I don t know if I would ever do it I 
377, clears throat 
378, I d be real curious to see whether I could be hypnotized I don t
379, know if I d 
380, oh I would too 
381, be afraid or laughs 
382, End
383,
