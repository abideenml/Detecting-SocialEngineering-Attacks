171, ctually this week he told me um it s a movie about this woman who
172, I think was a nurse 
173, and actually did a lot of work and did a lot of good stuff but then
174, when she got married 
175, her mother in law is very traditional and so she stopped working
176, because it was making her husband unhappy 
177, right 
178, and then there was um some kind of disaster that had happened when
179, a plague or something I think 
180, and so she brought her skills back out into the open and cures
181, people and does really good things and 
182, so it it gets into um some of the problems of traditional sie 
183, society and roles of women sort of pro feminist kind of stuff 
184, Sounded neat to me
