274, You re kidding 
275, No I m serious laugh 
276, ut I m still coming 
277, distortion xxx did you ever um get in touch with uh I had given
278, you the the other the fax of the number of the girl in uh xxx
279, distortion 
280, You mean the xxx y um yeah well I I I did fax them a letter 
281, It was little bit after that date like maybe a week later 
282, yeah 
283, I faxed them a letter and I never heard from them 
284, nd I had and I ha 
285, I ba basically what she kind of said is you know come and we ll
286, talk sort of thing 
287, uhhuh 
288, yeah so basically the one okay the well Interns For Peace
289, retracted their offer because they decided I wasn t enthusiastic
290, enough 
291, Who s this 
292, um Interns For Peace 
293, mhm 
294, Like they had offered me a place and then they took it back 
295, ut didn t you also say you you were still weren t that keen on
296, them 
297, Right I wasn t but I still would have rather rejected them than
298, have them reject me 
299, yeah 
300, yeah 
301, nd then um lipsmack and then the next place which I was so
302, hopeful about was was um lipsmack Moden Nisan 
303, yeah 
304, yeah 
305, That thing at Haifa with eh the Young Women s Leadership Program 
306, yeah 
307, nd the woman made it sound so promising and I waited two months to
308, hear back 
309, mhm 
310, nd then I hadn t heard from her and it was after the date so I
311, called 
312, mhm 
313, nd she said oh I was going to fax you this evening um you know
314, we re not really sure what s happening 
315, The position may be being redefined 
316, eh 
317, nd then a week later she called me and left a message saying oh
318, you know they had all these things on the burner and r I should
319, really look someplace else because they don t know what s going on
320, and 
321, hm 
322, nd so th I had really stopped looking for things because he made
323, it sound so promising and like it was going to be almost fulltime 
324, hm 
325, nd then 
326, That s a shame distorted 
327, nd then it you know so instead it and now it s like you know maybe
328, a ten hour a week position and it requires fluent Hebrew and it s
329, just totally different than what we had talked about 
330, That s a shame 
331, nd so then meanwhile Giva Haviva had offered me a a very short
332, term parttime internship 
333, yeah you mentioned by writing up something to 
334, yeah like helping with grant writing and miscellaneous things and
335, living on a nearby kibbutz s yid maybe is it Ma anit 
336, hm 
337, You could be even living at David s and Savia s and get to
338, Giva Haviva 
339, yeah but it might be nice to be on the kibbutz s yid because then
340, I would get to know some people 
341, yeah 
342, yeah 
343, ut anyway so then ah but that was three months ago that they
344, offered me that and you know who knows if they found someone so I
345, faxed them about a week and a half ago 
346, yeah 
347, mhm 
348, nd I hadn t heard back from them and so I I called the New York
349, office and she said she d get back to me probably you know yesterday
350, or today as soon as she could talk with them 
351, hm 
352, mhm 
353, ecause maybe they found someone I don t know 
354, yeah 
355, So that s I m I m really hoping that that would work out you know 
356, it s just something 
357, yeah 
358, ut if not I mean I m just coming anyway but I have no idea like
359, where I ll go 
360, When are you planning on coming 
361, nd 
362, Sometime either like mid to late September or early October 
363, mhm 
364, mhm 
365, um 
366, ecause I m thinking that I d like to stop in Europe on the way and
367, visit some friends 
368, I have a friend in Spain and a friend in France and a and a friend
369, in Germany 
370, End
371,
