,0
0,and I froze 
1, One bag full of halves 
2, to make unt nnie s peach cake 
3, mhm 
4, in the Winter 
5, so we ll see what happens 
6, I made a wonderful peach thing last week 
7, um you know the recipe book that Jane gave me 
8, yeah 
9, at Christmas time from 
10, deserts from your bread maker 
11, yeah 
12, well you make the dough breath and you leave it in the bread
13, maker until it goes through a couple of cycles of 
14, ye kneading and raising and all that kind of stuff and then you
15, take it out 
16, before it bakes 
17, mhm 
18, and you divide it into two and let it sit for a few minutes 
19, and then press into like a round um 
20, pizza pan 
21, oh 
22, and then I put now the kids had picked berries along the road 
23, um 
24, uh raspberries blackberries and huckleberries 
25, So I made one with uh that on it 
26, and the other one I sliced peaches real thin and then you put
27, cinnamon sugar and and melted butter 
28, on the top and bake it and of course it s a real 
29, you know it s a yeast dough 
30, mhm 
31, uh it s a real good dough 
32, yeah and good 
33, and boy they were and it it tells you 
34, the recipe actually calls breath for some kind of a um 
35, on it it says either unflavored whipped cream or uh sour cream 
36, something like that 
37, so we just used Cool Whip and it was 
38, it was very good it was very nice I took one I coo 
39, uhhuh 
40, to the guy across the road who cut the grass for us while we were
41, away 
42, uhhuh 
43, and um I I 
44, and he enjoy it 
45, I have no idea 
46, um as a matter of fact I keep meaning to ask him and we ve been xxx
47, 
48, we ve talked on several occasions they kind of paved our road this
49, week 
50, oh 
51, um exhale 
52, what do you mean kind of 
53, well 
54, have the new people have been after him about 
55, the potholes and the dust and everything else you know 
56, mhm 
57, and she goes down there on a regular 
58, basis and and raises a fuss 
59, mhm 
60, and um they finally said well then they d be out 
61, and they exhale they um 
62, oh I don t know it was uh 
63, they it it just keeps get getting pushed back and back well finally
64, they came out I think out Monday 
65, uh well no actually when we came home we noticed that they d shaved
66, some some of the 
67, uh swale off across the road 
68, now they still have not fixed that pipe which is my big complaint
69, the whole time 
70, mhm 
71, It s still hanging up in the air and Everhart is beside himself
72, because 
73, we asked them to sink that pipe so that people wouldn t get their
74, tires cut on it you know 
75, mhm 
76, well they never ha they didn t do that but 
77, um exhale what they did wa well now let me see first Monday 
78, they turned off the water here all uh all morning on Monday 
79, because the pipe had sprung a leak 
80, uhhuh 
81, so they had to fix that before they could do the road then they
82, came down Tuesday and they did all this preparation work 
83, they dug 
84, they put a pipe um sort of 
85, caddywampus n under under the road just below 
86, our driveway and before the new peoples driveway 
87, but the way they put it in mother 
88, and left it 
89, it blocked our pipe so that anything that would ve gone 
90, through our pipe would ve backed up immediately 
91, and and flooded our property 
92, exhale 
93, What kind of engineers do they have working down there 
94, oh Everhart said he doesn t think they have any idea at all you
95, know 
96, well I went up to help um 
97, the band 
98, people help uh fit band uniforms 
99, yeah 
100, lipsmack Now you know that in my day we got our uniforms fit but
101, there weren t parents you know 
102, this is all done by the parents 
103, oh 
104, um so I went up to help 
105, and I got there at eight o clock and around eleven I called home
106, and Everhart was beside himself 
107, uh you know as soon as the kids told him it was me he told them to
108, tell her 
109, wha that they d made a colossal mess out of the road 
110, and um so I said to Virginia I ve got to go I ve got to go see
111, what s wrong 
112, well the i they dug this deep trench and 
113, put these huge rocks 
114, in the road 
115, Now when I back out I have to be careful 
116, that I don t go into the ditch across the road where these great
117, big huge rocks are 
118, mm 
119, um exhale you know I I can t I just can t even begin to tell you
120, well 
121, at any rate they got all that done 
122, and then they came along and 
123, what they re buying now is stuff 
124, called well it s crushed asphalt it s recycled road basically 
125, yeah 
126, and um 
127, they told us that 
128, inhales it s it 
129, holds up better than the stone that they d been putting on 
130, and it also um 
131, well it it s so delightful to come down the road and not be
132, followed by a cloud of dust you know 
133, yeah 
134, but they put it all on and smoothed it they they came down with uh
135, great big heavy rollers and 
136, all that kind of stuff and 
137, um it it actually looks like road out there 
138, so xxx 
139, uh exhale I m pleased about that you know the way they did the
140, other stuff 
141, well that s g 
142, and I said to him I said to Everhart 
143, it s not m they did come back and dig out 
144, our ditch 
145, mhm 
146, and fill our ditch with stones too great big stones 
147, eh 
148, and I said Everhart 
149, just don t get upset about because 
150, if the lot next to us ever gets built on 
151, they re going to have to come back and do it again 
152, yeah 
153, because there s no place 
154, i i there s 
155, the pipe that they put in will pour water right into this pe 
156, person s front yard 
157, hm 
158, um you know and and I said I I can t help it that they do things in
159, such a 
160, dumb way that s you know it s it s very annoying it s very
161, frustrating especially when you re paying for the privilege of
162, having them make a mess 
163, yeah yeah 
164, you know 
165, so there was a terrible accident down here last night terrible 
166, um up
