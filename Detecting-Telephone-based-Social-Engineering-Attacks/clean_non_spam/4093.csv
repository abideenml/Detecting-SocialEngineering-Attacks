,0
0,ut uh yeah it s still it s still fairly e e it s still a
1, fairly expensive call but uh 
2, but it s a lot less expensive if we do it that way than if we than
3, if we actually make my my my parents in law pay it then it 
4, the Dutch have such high taxes on those they consider it a luxury
5, to call around the world so 
6, they tax it really high 
7, nyway um 
8, So you guys will be in either the eighteenth or the nineteenth and
9, you re going to go to uh msterdam 
10, Well I would say is once you re at a hotel

14, arrangements that day 
15, um that I can meet you in msterdam 
16, nd maybe I ll come by m public transport 
17, It s s probably easier for me to come by public transport in
18, msterdam than it is for me to come by car to be honest 
19, mhm 
20, The streets are small and there s no parking 
21, So I probably will come by public transport but I don t know 
22, We ll see where you re staying 
23, um 
24, and there s a lot more for you guys if you want to see stuff you
25, can see stuff in msterdam breath and uh

32, and I can take you to some places we can go see uh go see some
33, stuff

40, So if you don t have any ideas we ll 
41, just put something together for you 
42, okay 
43, um but yeah but I can pick you up th you know I ll probably be
44, there some time around six and we can like do do a quick dinner or
45, something and then go uh

47, to stay in msterdam that s fine 
48, If you want to go uh

50, breath e echte s deu Holland real Holland 
51, laughs 
52, and we can do that too 
53, ctually I ve I ve been up to Holland before 
54, Spent about two weeks up distortion there 
55, breath yeah 
56, So um but that was years and years ago 
57, With your parents when your father was stationed over here right 
58, 
59, yeah

62, ut um 
63, Has has Kim been here before 
64, nd an 
65, No 
66, oh good quietly 
67, ut then again I m I m not sure that Kim would be interested in
68, seeing Shape Headquarters and you know all that kind of stuff 
69, laughs 
70, those military things 
71, inhales Would you be interested in seeing s seeing Shape
72, Headquarters again 
73, No 
74, Not really laughs 
75, laughs yeah 
76, I di I didn t think so 
77, Somehow I had this feeling that th th the military taste had
78, been beaten out of you 
79, laughs yep 
80, I m the mil I can t say too bad things about the military
81, though 
82, They still have my goods and they ll probably hold them hostage 
83, laughs 
84, nd they own my body and soul for like another four years so I just
85, got to pray that they 
86, oh do they 
87, yeah 
88, I ha I owe four years in active reserve time 
89, aw great 
90, Do they do that to everyone 
91, Milo get out of there distortion 
92, yeah everyone who 
93, eh everyone who s uh who hasn t been like you were you went
94, through like the thirty six two process 
95, mhm 
96, So you don t ha you don t have it but if yeah if you just
97, separate normally and you haven t served at least eight years then
98, you owe it 
99, nd that s one of those things they just never tell you up front 
100, clears throat No 
101, They never said anything I me I figured there was something like
102, that because 
103, nd I was I was in the inactive reserves the entire time I was in
104, college too 
105, So 
106, yeah 
107, Th that s I mean that s the military 
108, I I have my my discharge papers and everything 
109, uhhuh 
110, and I ve they I ve I ve said that yeah I will give a urine
111, sample or a blood sample if they w if they call me back for those 
112, but they re going to have to pay my trip back to the states 
113, laughs because there s no bases in Holland and I m not going to
114, pay out of my own expenses to go to Germany or something for them 
115, If they want me they can pay bring me back active duty and pay me
116, for the day 
117, laughs 
118, if they re going to drag me off somewhere 
119, ut uh first they have to find me 
120, yeah that s the other xxx distortion it was i 
121, xxx 
122, if you re in another country I mean and you re not planning on
123, coming back to the U S what do y what are they going to do even if
124, you don t 
125, yeah 
126, Well I mean I m still merican citizen and I still inhales would
127, like to be welcome in my own country laughs 
128, laughs 
129, lthough g uh I mean if if if they denied my citizenship and I
130, became a citizen here I probably wouldn t h be a horror either 
131, but uh yeah right now I m I mean I do want to keep my merican
132, citizenship so 
133, u I kind of want to 
134, re you going to become a dual citizen 
135, What s that 
136, re you going to try and become a dual citizen 
137, Have dual citizenship distorted 
138, You can t do 
139, You can t do that um the only way to be a dual citizen is if
140, you re born in a foreign country like if I were born in in in
141, Holland and then when and then had merican parents 
142, Then I could be a dual citizen 
143, ut you can t 
144, If I would to ask to become a citizen in Holland I would
145, automatically lose my merican citizenship 
146, s far as the mericans are concerned yeah 
147, yeah 
148, The Dutch could care less 
149, The Dutch would say fine want to be a dual citizen that s fine 
150, but the mericans as soon as you ask for another citizenship 
151, that act of asking for it t takes away your merican citizenship 
152, 
153, I mean it s kind of stupid 
154, yeah 
155, So I m a merican ri I m a I m an expatriot 
156, n merican expatriot 
157, n merican living abroad 
158, laughs 
159, xxx I still have to file a tax return 
160, Do you 
161, yeah 
162, ut my first seventy five thousand dollars worth of income is tax
163, free 
164, Good grief 
165, s long as I don t bring it back to the states 
166, Good grief 
167, I R S for you huh 
168, yeah laughs 
169, laughs oh they want their share 
170, They want their piece of meat 
171, ut u u all foreign taxes are deductible and my taxes here are
172, fifty percent of income 
173, So the taxes here are so much higher that yeah I would never have
174, to worry about it 
175, laughs Unless you became C E O of the company then then maybe
176, like a thousand dollars would be taxable right 
177, yeah 
178, Somehow it raises a small amount 
179, laughs 
180, The problem s going to be the problem s going to be uh 
181, be nya s merican salary is taxable here and at fifty percent so
182, we re going to owe some money to the Dutch government on her salary 
183, 
184, aw 
185, Some amount that has that has to be deducted a certain amount and
186, the amount we pay the merican government is deductible but j 
187, we ll still owe 
188, some taxes 
189, Th see I don t know how it works 
190, We re going to need to have some we re going to be in need of some
191, sort of accountant do it cause I have no clue 
192, how that all works 
193, They don t have the Quicken Dutch version 
194, yeah laughs 
195, laughs ah you know I wouldn t trust it because it s so
196, complicated with this international garbage 
197, Or or else the Turbo Tax with the the Dutch modules 
198, that I d 
199, yeah 
200, I somehow I just wouldn t trust it 
201, I don t know eh 
202, yeah 
203, So complicated when you re dealing with a Dutch tax form nya had
204, to read it and nya and her father didn t understand the damn thing 
205, 
206, laughs 
207, How am I supposed to understand it 
208, I m really looking forward to moving to Oregon and dealing with 
209, Oregon you pay state tax Washington you don t 
210, I m looking forward to that 
211, cause uh 
212, yeah but you ll be a s 
213, You ll be a student so you I mean you re what what is your
214, income 
215, oh well 
216, See I think y um it ll probably be about five thousand dollars
217, for the for the portion of the next year that I m in Oregon or the
218, portion of this year that I m in Oregon and then breath next year
219, it ll be eleven thousand 
220, yeah 
221, ut you ll be below 
222, y I mean you re below the poverty line at that level 
223, yeah 
224, So laughs I mean i i any income that y 
225, Well 
226, ut then I ve already made say like fifteen thousand or whatever
227, here in Washington but 
228, That should be non taxable out of state income 
229, It should but you know 
230, It it just it s not going to be a fun tax return year 
231, laughs I had that when I went into the military 
232, laughs ut then again xxx distortion 
233, I had Kans I had to file three taxes 
234, I had to file Georgia Kansas and yeah and then my federal 
235, So 
236, laughs 
237, Well um actually I think this phone call s just about to end
238, cause it s only half an hour but um 
239, So let s see 
240, I ll I ll give you a call 
241, when we arrive in h or maybe I ll just call you when we get in
242, Holland just to let you know we re there so if we get in the
243, eighteenth or the nineteenth 
244, and then call you back when um when we get to a hotel or something
245, like that 
246, okay that s a that s a great idea 
247, If you as soon as you get into Holland and get yourself settled 
248, you can call me and uh 
249, if I m if it s at night just call nya s parents 
250, okay so 
251, and remember that if you dial in Holland you need to add a zero so
252, like right now it s 
253, okay 
254, it s one eight one zero area code 
255, If you dial in Holland it s zero one eight one zero 
256, okay 
257, in Holland 
258, and and then yeah you can just call up if if it s if it s during
259, the work hours fine call me at work 
260, If not call nya s parents 
261, if you don t have a new phone number for me 
262, nd if you do I ll send it by email 
263, okay 
264, if I get it before th this weekend 
265, I ll we ll email you something but if you don t get email then just
266, call nya s parents 
267, If we have a phone by then they ll be able to give you the number
268, 
269, okay 
270, and just remember to ask for her mother 
271, and it s Goode right 
272, ode 
273, ode 
274, ode as in a abode 
275, abode 
276, minus the 
277, okay 
278, great 
279, laughs 
280, laughs and yeah and I think uh clears throat it s uh it s not
281, Frau uh ah it s uh 
282, It s Mifrau Mifrau is the uh 
283, is is is it s xxx Frau in German it s Frau 
284, mhm 
285, and then Dutch it s Mifrau 
286, I ll probably never remember that so hope they won t be offended
287, distortion 
288, nah don t worry about it 
289, You can just call her Missus you can just call her Missus and speak
290, English to her 
291, She ll she understands just talk slowly and clearly 
292, okay 
293, and once you re in Holland the line will be really clear 
294, I mean the phones here are pretty good 
295, once you re in the country 
296, It s just these over over mer to merica it s always kind of iffy
297, 
298, End
299,
