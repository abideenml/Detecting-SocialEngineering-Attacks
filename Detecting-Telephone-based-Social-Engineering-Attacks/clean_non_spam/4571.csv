156, He s twenty and she s just turned eighteen now 
157, Wow 
158, he doesn t live here um 
159, He had kind of well so it s a long long story but um lipsmack
160, at one point 
161, when I got real irritated with Oscar everybody in the family
162, insisted that I was an idiot and I should make him take care of his
163, children which you know I really believed laughing when I was
164, there and I and i I mean it does make a lot of 
165, lipsmack intellectual sense I guess 
166, ut it really I didn t want to do that to the kids but I did and so
167, I sent them to stay with him and breath then 
168, I felt bad about it immediately and then he wouldn t let them come
169, back and so it turned into a situation where Lehia was really the
170, one that wanted to come back and Oscar junior kind of um decided
171, that living with his father was what he wanted 
172, mhm 
173, nd Lehia s mom used to beg him to let her come back and he d say
174, yes and then he d hang up the phone and he d say I d never let you
175, go back there laughs you know breath I mean it was real stupid 
176, It wasn t really that he wanted her around but it was just it I
177, don t know 
178, People do stupid things 
179, hm 
180, oh 
181, hm so they re living with him 
182, No um now how long 
183, Probably two years ago then we she and I worked it out where I got
184, power of attorney from her mom because her mom always had custody
185, and she called me one day when 
186, there was nobody in the house but her and I drove and got her and
187, kind of stole her back it was kind of exciting laughs I couldn t
188, believe that I d ever do that but oh well it was very exciting
189, actually because 
190, oh my gosh 
191, laughs 
192, xxx distortion I mean I had to drive like two and half hours so
193, we you know you didn t know at any moment somebody might be coming
194, home 
195, I said get your stuff ready and I called her when I got to the
196, corner you know it was breath it was really something and we
197, just packed the car full 
198, I mean there s wasn t one inch of space left breath and then we
199, just flew out of there and we went to the nearest McDonalds to kind
200, of repack where we could breathe easy laughs 
201, oh my gosh 
202, It was pretty funny and then you know he never said a thing about
203, it 
204, yeah he 
205, hm 
206, you know he d I know that he knew she was better off here 
207, and she had told me that she almost committed suicide once but you
208, know he doesn t even know any of it because breath it s not that
209, he doesn t care about his kids but he s not really capable of being
210, a father 
211, You know he just 
212, hm 
213, close 
214, xxx So what s Lehia doing

223, breath in the last year he was he graduated one year ago from high
224, school and he started going to school in Missouri and 
225, then just out of the blue he told me that he and his buddy wanted
226, to move back to Omaha and go to school here which was really
227, surprising and that he was kind of saying that it living with his
228, father wasn t what he you know he kind of had 
229, his opinion on it has had changed but they wanted to live in an
230, apartment 
231, They didn t want to burden me anymore were his words but you know

246, have been going on and 
247, Wow 
248, I 
249, Well it s interesting 
250, re you working or are you teaching 
251, oh yes 
252, Well I don t teach um I 
253, yeah 
254, let s see well I came back I I taught adult basic education
255, because it was really hard to get a job in home ec which is it s
256, probably still that way and I went for my masters in counseling 
257, and 
258, uhhuh 
259, um 
260, actually I was asked to come back and be the counselor at the
261, merican school and that was the year I was pregnant with Noel and I
262, was really torn I didn t know what to do 
263, but my doctor didn t want me to go back to Honduras because I d
264, been so sick before 
265, He felt that y 
266, mhm 
267, I really needed 
268, We didn t know how the pregnancy was going to go breath but I I
269, feel like I really I mean I wasn t really paying that much attention
270, to what he said but that did influence a little bit breath 
271, so I didn t go 
272, hm 
273, and uh let s see what would I I guess I was working part time
274, that year doing part time counseling jobs and then that next year I
275, had two o well I had one offer that I had to take 
276, The other one was we were waiting for a principal to come back um
277, 
278, mhm 
279, but I ended up 
280, I wanted to go into high school counseling but I couldn t because
281, the principal was out on this boat they told me and he c had to
282, make the decision it s like oh 
283, laughs 
284, I need th I need this breath need to know fast because I m
285, pregnant and I cannot you know risk losing a job 
286, So I ended up working at the 
287, Sure 
288, community college which wasn t what I wanted at the time but a as
289, it s turned out it probably was the best um and I like it real
290, well 
291, I l I was cou I counseled for about five years and now I m in
292, administration um 
293, oh great 
294, End
