1, but I think one of the reasons is because Eliza like you have 
2, emotionally like 
3, you re content because you have your close friends from before and
4, at home 
5, so you re not you don t have this emotional void 
6, you know 
7, and that s why like you re still fine 
8, I think it makes kind of like it makes sense
