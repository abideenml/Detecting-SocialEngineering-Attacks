1, involved in initial public offering stock offerings 
2, mhm 
3, for companies 
4, yeah 
5, Listing companies on exchanges creating ah ah de depositories
6, receipts in the United States for foreign companies 
7, and so forth 
8, Right 
9, ll sorts of things just to raise capital on public markets 
10, mhm 
11, nd then there s the debt side which is um the side which deals
12, in bonds 
13, mhm 
14, they they go out and they try and find buyers for bonds 
15, Right 
16, Institutional investors and so forth breath and then you ve got
17, the um 
18, ah the traders the stocks and bonds traders and 
19, Right 
20, nd the for I don t know if they do foreign exchange but they 
21, I m sure they do even have that hedging and stuff 
22, nd then aside from all those clear cut kind of special ah 
23, ah focus services they ve got their at least the big ones like
24, Goldman Sachs and others 
25, have their strategic advisor services 
26, Now the Goldman Sachs that works for Deutch Telecom 
27, mhm

38, ut the the the investment banks that are driving me crazy are
39, always strategic investors 
40, ecause they show up and they what they re out there to do is 
41, there s a lot of companies that they can t either can t raise
42, money or they can t raise the type of money they want on stock
43, exchanges 
44, mhm 
45, They don t have enough credit worthiness to go out and get a bond 
46, 
47, mhm

49, strategic stake 
50, in their companies 
51, Selling a piece of the company on ah ah pu ah you know ah 
52, that changes hands privately 
53, Selling a piece of the company to a foreign investor usually

69, they ll sell what twenty five percent of the company to a private 
70, to a foreign investor 
71, mhm 
72, nd the foreign investor will come in and and and restructure the
73, company and then together they ll go ah go to the stock market 
74, Right 
75, nd it s an opportunity it s a big opportunity for a lot of
76, companies out there
