186, tired laughs 
187, nyway um that s a really cool class because they you get to learn
188, all the history behind everything 
189, nd it starts making things in the ible make sense you know 
190, oh yeah 
191, you know you find out oh okay I understand you know okay when this
192, happened when braham was journeying and 
193, What was going on politically in the area what was going on
194, culturally in the area and all of a sudden the stories kind of make
195, sense 
196, nd it just they just come to life you know it s really neat I like
197, it a lot and then I have um 
198, then I have um my Jewish Culture class um taught by rabbi Rosen 
199, 
200, he s really really good really good teacher um and ah tha that s
201, been interesting to to learn about yeah 
202, Does he speak English pretty well 
203, yeah actually he s ritish and he speaks with this really cool
204, ritish accent I love listening to him talk he uses all of these 
205, um cool words and in his ritish accident accent it just it just
206, kind of sounds kind of neat laughs 
207, he s an he s a neat figure he s really um energetic and anyway um
208, he ah 
209, and then there s this rab Civilization class that I take from um
210, from rother xxx he s an rab here 
211, a very prominent rab um Muslim down here he really was
212, influential in um getting the center built here 
213, he worked with President Hunter a lot that knew him very well he is
214, so neat and I wrote I wrote this in my letter so you ll get it twice
215, but 
216, um he was talking to us one time in one of our classes and he was
217, saying um somebody asked him he s known as a dry Mormon 
218, down here and so somebody asked him kind of what that meant and and
219, he said 
220, he just started he kind of laughed and he started going on about
221, how he first came in contact with the church and President Hunter
222, and 
223, and uh he said and he just started getting all he got all choked
224, up you know and started to cry 
225, and ah he you know had to stop and kind of excuse himself but he
226, said um he said that 
227, he said that he always felt like in Islam they believe that
228, Mohammed was a prophet 
229, hm 
230, nd they believe in all the other prophets that the Old Testament
231, and the New Testament you know that Jesus was a prophet an 
232, anyway but they believe that Mohammed was the last prophet you know
233, and so he was the seal of the prophet 
234, they don t worship em him or anything they just believe that he was
235, a prophet and and um 
236, anyway he said it always didn t seem right to me that God would not
237, send any more prophets down to the earth that Mohammed would be the
238, last one 
239, that he wouldn t give his people guidance you know that that would
240, be it you know because he s seen a lot in his religion 
241, answers that they don t have and problems that you know people kind
242, of go astray in these different ways because they don t know 
243, you know and it s funny because I learn about the Jewish religion
244, and it s the same thing you see all of these divisions happening and
245, all of these questions and you ask 
246, you know there s the old joke um if you ask ah three Jewish men a
247, question you ll get four opinions 
248, laughs 
249, You know tha I mean they re just 
250, they re very you know you you really do laughs I ve talked to
251, several of them you really get different things 
252, because you know there s the ultra orthodox and the reformed and
253, the anyway um 
254, and so he was just saying that ah he never thought that that was
255, right and he said when I um 
256, whenever I am with your prophet President Hunter I he says I cannot
257, explain it it s just a feeling inside 
258, and then he d say do you know what I mean 
259, and we were all just silent you know and 
260, laughs 
261, and just nodding our heads and he says 
262, yup laughs 
263, he says I just cannot help but feel that that this is a man of God
264, 
265, End
266,
