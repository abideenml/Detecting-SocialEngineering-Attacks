252, the other thing is I ve been thinking about and I I think I ve
253, pretty much just decided not to do it but breath 
254, I was thinking about being an egg donor actually at a local 
255, Wow 
256, reproductive medicine clinic sniff 
257, um 
258, breath largely because it paid fifteen hundred dollars breath 
259, 
260, laughs 
261, ut I went in for the preliminary exam 
262, um an interview 
263, did that just yesterday breath 
264, and um 
265, laughs 
266, side from it sounding kind of scary 
267, I mean I could probably do scary for fifteen hundred dollars

280, breath 
281, so you know maybe at some point in the future 
282, huh

286, Right 
287, Right 
288, I figure it s probably not exactly a novelty out there 
289, sneeze So

291, Though e on my way home on the bus I m thinking 
292, I m like selling my body here 
293, They call it oocyte donation but they pay you fifteen hundred
294, dollars to do it

297, breath That s very interesting 
298, It is interesting 
299, breath It s not some 
300, It s a very interesting process really 
301, Really 
302, yeah 
303, I mean they explained like how they use the hormones to 
304, like turn off your ovaries and then 
305, overstimulate them and 
306, then how they harvest the eggs 
307, Which is not exactly a pleasant sounding experience breath
