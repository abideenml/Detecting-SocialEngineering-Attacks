,0
0,You d never know it though she was a workaholic and really a very
1, uh very very attractive woman you know 
2, but uh but anyway so what else it new you know 
3, well let s see our construction has started 
4, oh yeah how s uh how s that problem you had with the uh 
5, and uh 
6, that s solved now expensive but it was solved laughs 
7, it was eh yeah I know you were telling me 
8, so very expensive 
9, yeah hm lipsmack 
10, involving a uh tremendous amount of money but uh it s solved and
11, 
12, yeah 
13, but you were thinking of suing the person at the uh 
14, well 
15, the cost of suing eh you know i it s uh muddy lawyers seem think
16, it s not really uh 
17, what was it 
18, xxx 
19, you know eh if it s not 
20, not not very happy about doing 
21, oh 
22, oh really 
23, ho how you making out with your ex law your la 
24, oh uh my case uh uh he s trying to uh my lawyer is trying to get
25, 
26, ill s lawyer to get together with a lawyer for Index Futures and
27, see if they can come up with a settlement 
28, mhm 
29, but so far no he says typically settlements are like on the very
30, last day 
31, you know on the uh you re sitting on the steps waiting for the
32, judge and that s when they settle you know 
33, yeah whe when when when you going to court 
34, but in a 
35, uh well it uh he thinks it s going to be postponed originally I
36, was telling you it was October sixteenth 
37, mhm 
38, now he thinks it 
39, more than likely it won t be till sometime in the middle of
40, December 
41, oh jesus 
42, so try to keep a date open laughs we ll I ll we ll try to let you
43, know what the date is because he he he really would prefer to either
44, have you there otherwise he ll videotape you 
45, yeah 
46, uh but now he s uh he s thinking it ll probably be delayed till 
47, 
48, I don t know he it s not delayed yet but the but he but the
49, brokerage house isn t answering the questions he asks 
50, does he is he still as confident as ever that there will be some
51, sort of a 
52, well he s no he s very confident that we ll win against Phil 
53, a meaningful settlement 
54, but he s not 
55, sure that we ll win against Index Futures because he said there s
56, it s as far as he could see there s no real precedent for that 
57, mhm 
58, pe in the next for this particular case he there s no
59, precedent 
60, but Phil s lawyer was probing around saying well what do you really
61, want 
62, you know so he said 
63, see we don t want to settle with Phil s lawyer 
64, prior to settling with Index Futures 
65, you know what I mean 
66, oh it seems Index Futures is deep pocket 
67, yeah yeah so he doesn t want to settle with him first so he said to
68, Phil s lawyer he said why don t you go 
69, get together with Index Futures though by the way they got a new
70, lawyer they went outside now they re not using their own lawyer 
71, oh is that right 
72, they went outside to another firm in Chicago 
73, and so he said to him go get together with him and see what you
74, guys can come up with you know 
75, in the meantime they re bringing in two experts so we got to bring
76, in an expert too that s going to cost a few thousand dollars 
77, jesus 
78, the expert is to say see their 
79, you have to p do you have to pay that or does that come out of the
80, settlement 
81, eh I pay the expenses 
82, hm 
83, so uh the expert 
84, Jesus how much you got in this thing already must be like ten
85, thousand dollars in already I ll bet 
86, well not not much no not so much uh thirty five hundred for him 
87, 
88, the lawyer 
89, mm 
90, eh so far in expenses maybe 
91, maybe uh fifteen hundred so far 
92, oh that s not bad 
93, but the but the the big expense would be this uh expert 
94, the ex we got to fly him in from Chicago probably 
95, put him up overnight and pay him 
96, how do you how do you find an expert like that ni 
97, I don t know he s going to find him he asked me if I knew anyone I
98, didn t 
99, uh because there s no commodity of experts in Philly 
100, most of them are in Chicago 
101, uh possibly New York or Washington 
102, mhm 
103, but mostly Chicago 
104, eh anyway he said he ll try to find one and actually he wants
105, someone who works for a commodities firm 
106, and there s a possibility they re all in cahoots together you know
107, they don t tes 
108, yeah that s that s I was just thinking the exact same 
109, that they don t testify against each other 
110, yeah that s what xxx had 
111, but 
112, but see they re bringing in two experts to say that it s common 
113, business practice to give those 
114, they admit that they gave Phil those internal printouts 
115, but they said it s common business practice to give them to
116, substantial customers 
117, but on the one hand they re arguing that Phil 
118, oh I m sorry ernice xxx ernice told me 
119, ernice says tell me that she can get that program with uh 
120, that girl on it 
121, oh you can 
122, yes 
123, it s on Life yeah so Jessica Savage it s on eight to ten and then I
124, think an hour after that is a documentary 
125, yeah 
126, very she must be pretty famous person 
127, well she was 
128, how old was sh how old was she she when she died

130, oh she was 
131, I don t know she was probably in her forties or something 
132, is that right oh god what a shame 
133, fifties maybe 
134, but uh but anyway she uh she was already you know big time she
135, was with a network she was with N C 
136, yeah 
137, she had gone off the local news on to the uh 
138, oh so she really made the big time then 
139, yeah and then she uh died she was in a restaurant which we ve been
140, to in New Hope you know not far 
141, and uh 
142, it s actually very tricky we we u 
143, when when I heard about the accident I realized that it could
144, easily happen 
145, there was a uh 
146, lipsmack oh I forget what it was there was a very tricky turn
147, when you leave the uh restaurant 
148, and they failed to make that turn and I think xxx I forget exactly
149, how th 
150, she died as a result of it you know 
151, yeah 
152, but but I remember that too and I said you know I always get got
153, confused when I left that restaurant that uh you could 
154, easily make a bad turn 
155, but anyway uh 
156, lipsmack I guess it was her boyfriend that was driving and uh I
157, don t u I can t remember the details anymore but they that s how
158, she got killed 
159, hm 
160, you know 
161, but anyway uh you had to be there for fifteen minutes because

193, yeah but in the meantime Judy got a job so they re only talking
194, about 
195, like six weeks worth of checks you know 
196, yeah tell me let me ask you a question does she have
197, hospitalization this new job 
198, I don 
199, eh 
200, yeah but they so far they haven t specifically told her what she
201, gets she has to pay for part of it which is typical nowadays 
202, yeah 
203, most companies don t give you full hospitalization anymore 
204, yeah we do but we re going to start changing too it s eh it s
205, getting so damn expensive 
206, yeah 
207, most companies are making the employees pick up 
208, uh you know up to half of it for whatever 
209, and I just finished you know remember I I got a one time job with a
210, f 
211, yeah ernice was telling me 
212, stayed at Delaware 
213, and they were tr real nice I enjoyed every every minute of it and
214, I uh I went up there and turned it over to them uh 
215, last Thursday 
216, great 
217, and then they re going to call in the 
218, they re going to call me in for a review 
219, uh 
220, and uh I I it depends how the review goes I don t know who s going
221, to be there to go over it with me 
222, they so typically they make you redo some of it you know or
223, whatever they make you 
224, spend more time on it 
225, but that was ni that was real nice I enjoyed it and 
226, and it was nice money for the time spent yeah 
227, so far I haven t received the money but I you know I think uh 
228, I think uh um I don t have any fears about that you know 
229, oh that s great yeah if that that if you get a few more of those
230, they 
231, yeah 
232, yeah oh jeez a couple 
233, what you do it where did you work to do it 
234, at home 
235, at home 
236, I own my own computer 
237, eh it was real nice I mean I really well mostly it wasn t even
238, computer work it was mostly uh just my thoughts getting my thoughts
239, out it was something I had done 
240, before at M C I and at Western Union 
241, and my friends eh 
242, that said that s what they wanted and uh so I you know it was
243, something I felt very comfortable with 
244, and I already did the uh 
245, lipsmack the project and I mean eh eh they just wanted the
246, specification for someone else to program it and I I wrote up the
247, specification I drew up uh 
248, oh about thirty four pages of very detailed flow charts 
249, hm 
250, which isn t exactly what he wanted but that s like old fashioned
251, laughing xxx flow chart but the guy um 
252, the guy that I xxx ga gave turned it over to he just had me spend
253, an afternoon explaining it to him 
254, and he didn t seem opposed to the way I did it 
255, and my friend said he s the fussiest guy I d have to worry about 
256, 
257, but he seemed okay 
258, so now it s um just a few other managers there they re going to
259, you know get together probably have me back again and explain it
260, again 
261, yeah 
262, tell me what s happened to Gary in his interviews 
263, xxx 
264, oh uh we re real hopeful he tomorrow we probably will find out
265, more he has two 
266, potential jo potential teach teaching jobs 
267, oh good 
268, One is um 
269, Pleasantville New Jersey which we re not too happy about because
270, it s black and it s very rough 
271, but they re the ones who uh called him back 
272, for a second interview 
273, and they said it was narrowed down to four people 
274, mhm 
275, well so he has a one out of four chance I guess 
276, but uh 
277, the the town is all black you know it s near tlantic City 
278, and it s no 
279, what town is it 
280, it s Pleasantville New Jersey it s all 
281, oh yeah suresure that s black 
282, it s it s it s all black and it xxx 
283, is that right 
284, it s it s tough it s a tough school 
285, so uh 
286, It would be nice for him to get the experience you know he wouldn t
287, necessarily live there but I on the other hand it may not be great
288, experie the other one is Edison New Jersey but they 
289, what we don t like about that is that s a nicer area probably but
290, uh and it s only a couple hours from here 
291, he d have to relocate either way 
292, but uh Edison uh 
293, the guy keeps changing his story at first he was talking about a
294, permanent position 
295, then he s saying well they re trying to get rid of one teacher they
296, have and if they re not able to get rid of that teacher 
297, he would be more of a long term sub on per diem 
298, hm 
299, so he changed the story from a first time to the second time 
300, anyway he s supposed to hear from both of them tomorrow 
301, and uh 
302, if he gets the 
303, I think if he gets the Pleasantville job he might take it 
304, because it is a regular 
305, fulltime job even though it might not be the great the great school
306, 
307, but it depends what they come back with at Edison too so tomorrow
308, he s suppos 
309, but a also it seems to me if you can survive the Pleasantville job
310, 
311, you d certainly a great uh uh on your resume 
312, yeah eh yeah that he was a full that he was a fulltime teacher 
313, sure 
314, and anytime he can look for others everybody in the school is black
315, everybody they were interviewing were black the principal is black 
316, 
317, really 
318, eh yeah it s uh it s like a 
319, eh it s just about a totally black community now 
320, no kidding 
321, and anyway the more he hears about the community the more he hears
322, it s not so great it s not 
323, not as bad as the big city black areas but it s 
324, well you said he s not going to live in Pleasantville 
325, no no he could live 
326, you know live somewhere nearby you know maybe in Egg Harbor or uh 
327, 
328, you know it could be 
329, do we dr do we drive through Pleasantville driving down to
330, tlantic City xxx distortion Philadel 
331, yeah well if you take the lack Horse Pike you re passing right
332, through Pleasantville 
333, End
334,
