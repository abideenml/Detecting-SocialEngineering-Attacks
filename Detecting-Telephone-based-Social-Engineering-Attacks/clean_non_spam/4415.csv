5, oh yeah 
6, yeah the base C O changed 
7, The clinic O I C changed 
8, The clinic 
9, C U nurse changed 
10, nd 
11, just trying to get uh you know the feel for how everybody else is
12, exhale 
13, you know going to respond to them and how they re going to
14, respond to 
15, everybody else has been trying to say the least for the past oh 
16, probably month or so 
17, yeah 
18, So 
19, Well I mean that s still a possibility 
20, I mean I just didn t 
21, yeah 
22, feel like it was the right time when I was home last 
23, So 
24, I don t know I saw Sayonara again 
25, I still see you with some little gal flying around going Karisan 
26, Karisan 
27, laughs 
28, The supper is ready 
29, com imitating Japanese accent 
30, Get thy ass on the table 
31, No 
32, Nothing like that going on over here 
33, yeah 
34, Well I ll tell you another a y Did you hear about Martha getting
35, married 
36, No 
37, Well this supposedly is going to happen 
38, Now it hasn t actually happened yet 
39, So e we may be at ground zero 
40, I called her to to chat whether I guess about two weeks ago 
41, um 
42, nd she d said oh hey ill 
43, y the way I m getting married laughs This is a typical Martha
44, pronouncement 
45, xxx Ye distortion 
46, It s like oh okay 
47, uh you know e tell me about this guy 
48, How long have you known him and all that 
49, oh well I ve been dating him in since pril 
50, but I haven t really told anybody 
51, nd I thought well this is true cause Martha you and I have been
52, in pretty good touch since pril and you never mentioned it 
53, ut this guy supposedly is a retired Marine pilot 
54, lipsmack um 
55, He just retired out so he s kind of thinking what he wants to do
56, now 
57, I think for some reason the guy was an six driver 
58, nd uh it seems like they just really hit it off and clicked 
59, nd I think he has one child but he doesn t have custody 
60, um 
61, So I don t have a whole lot of scoop on this guy 
62, ut they haven t set a date or anything 
63, They just decided they were going to get married and do it real
64, informal and all this and 
65, lipsmack distortion laughs 
66, I know laugh 
67, So 
68, I asked if he was drinking buddies with Luke and that didn t go
69, over real good 
70, So laughing 
71, laughs 
72, So I don t know a whole lot of the scoop 
73, laughs 
74, ut uh she s still in San Diego and seems to have settled pretty
75, much there 
76, lipsmack uh 
77, In mine uh I ve changed qui I m trying to remember 
78, Last time I probably talked to you was what last spring 
79, yeah 
80, I know we re the we re the world s best at keeping in touch 
81, inhales Well I m on the road now moving from New Orleans 
82, I m finally left The ig Easy and I m going up to Vermont 
83, believe it or not for graduate school 
84, oh you are 
85, xxx distorted 
86, yeah 
87, I finally decided to go ahead and get on the ball 
88, nd I knew I wanted to teach English as a second language as a
89, career but I d never really done anything about it 
90, So I started doing it in New Orleans as a private tutor and then
91, got picked up by a little private school down there to teach for a
92, couple of months inhales nd knew this was what I wanted to do so
93, I got it uh 
94, I applied and got accepted into graduate school up in Vermont 
95, specializes in kicking you out into a one year Master s program 
96, do that 
97, So this starts in late ugust and I m on the way up there kind of
98, meandering up to the states and inhales seeing anybody and
99, everybody 
100, So if your dead old behind was in the States I could you know 
101, make a point to go by and find you but since you re still in 
102, yeah 
103, the land of xxx large explosions I haven t been able to do that 
104, yeah 
105, Well your tour is what three years Ker or did you get 
106, No it s only two 
107, I ve only got about six months left over here 
108, I was going to say I thought you were winding up 
109, Do you know where you re going yet 
110, yeah Twenty Nine Stumps 
111, You re kidding me 
112, No 
113, aw good deal 
114, I think I know some folks out there 
115, yeah well you know 
116, I d I called the detailer and I had originally uh lipsmack
117, applied for a fellowship to work with the Joint Commission on
118, ccreditation of Hospitals 
119, mhm 
120, Which would have been a year long out service fellowship up in
121, Chicago which 
122, the the town that they had this 
123, fellowship in was 
124, like five minutes from where I went to college and 
125, Right 
126, ten minutes from where I went to high school 
127, Right 
128, So I thought yeah it d be great 
129, You know 
130, ut uh they picked some physician to go 
131, yeah 
132, So the only other choice they gave me was either uh Great
133, Mistakes 
134, mhm 
135, or Twenty Nine Palms 
136, mhm 
137, nd the detailer uh 
138, I said well let me think about it for a while 
139, n and probably forty five minutes after I hung up with her she
140, called me back 
141, and said that she had spoken to the director of nursing out at
142, Twenty Nine Palms 
143, mhm 
144, and the director of nursing out there 
145, wanted me 
146, to be the department head for emergency nursing 
147, Wow 
148, So 
149, I don t know this lady but um you know I ve got my sub
150, specialty in that and 
151, Sure 
152, with the experience that I ve got so inhales 
153, You know I eventually got back to her and said yeah I ll go ahead
154, and go out there 
155, yeah 
156, Well I was going to say 
157, ecause I know you re still the lieutenant commander right 
158, yeah

160, r are you looking towards ho breath how soon would commander
161, be coming around the pike for you Kerry 
162, ah well I would be in zone next next year 
163, okay so that wouldn t blow the department head thing if you pick
164, up commander would it 
165, ut 
166, No no uh uh 
167, ut guess who got deep selected 
168, For commander 
169, yeah 
170, Let me think 
171, oh it s got to be arney 
172, oh yeah laughs 
173, Well now I also heard 
174, Now I think I heard this from Martha 
175, I heard arney had some kind of terminal disease 
176, Well arney has cancer 
177, okay 
178, uh he had some sort of uh 
179, lipsmack uh 
180, mouth and throat cancer 
181, yeah 
182, You know he s a big golfer 
183, Right 
184, n d golfers tend to when th after they tee off they stick their
185, golf tee in their mouth 
186, oh no 
187, yeah well they think that this cancer developed from the the bug
188, spray and the weed killer that they put on the the grass 
189, oh man 
190, yeah so I I saw arn I was back in the States in March 
191, nd uh 
192, I saw arney at this convention that I was at 
193, yeah 
194, nd he was as skinny as you are 
195, You re kidding me 
196, No 
197, Good god 
198, Cause he was always built like a seal or something 
199, He was huge 
200, yeah 
201, nd uh lipsmack you know he had gone through chemo
202, chemotherapy and was in the process of getting radiation so he
203, like had 
204, you know one hair per 
205, square inch on his head 
206, yeah 
207, nd uh could barely talk because that s where they were focusing
208, the radiation 
209, Right 
210, uh and he looked u he looked like death warmed over 
211, You know he 
212, yeah 
213, You see the uschwitz pictures and that was arney 
214, arney von Lipstien 
215, yeah 
216, yeah 
217, ut um yeah he worked for uh General uh 
218, Krulac 
219, okay 
220, okay 
221, You just said the magic words 
222, So 
223, mhm 
224, I got you 
225, yeah I ve got another buddy who uh is a marine pilot 
226, I m trying to think if you had ever met 
227, this guy 
228, I don t think so 
229, He um inhales worked for him as an aide 
230, nd so he was chuckling the other day w well probably the other
231, day the other year when he heard Krulac had been selected to be the
232, next big boy 
233, nd he thought you know ill whatever happens I m good to go now 
234, I m golden 
235, oh yeah 
236, yeah it was it was a real surprise to hear e and when I talked
237, to arney he wasn t 
238, Wow 
239, we didn t really spend a whole lot of time talking about the the
240, cancer 
241, yeah 
242, yeah 
243, ut I I asked him I said you know I asked him point blank I
244, said what was xxx what the prognosis was 
245, yeah 
246, nd he said poor 
247, um but he didn t say terminal 
248, yeah 
249, um 
250, okay I think I had kind of assumed that I guess from talking to
251, Martha because she may have over glorified it 
252, I don t know 
253, Well you know 
254, and arney s wife arb is down in Sansabel 
255, mhm 
256, nd I talk to her fairly frequently 
257, nd she said that um 
258, mhm 
259, she just saw him a couple of months ago 
260, mhm 
261, nd that he was starting to gain weight back again 
262, So 
263, Super 
264, You know I don t know whether they managed to get all the cancer
265, with the chemo chemotherapy and the radiation or or what 
266, yeah 
267, ut uh 
268, You know I y I knew when the list came out I didn t even have to
269, look you know because I knew that both arney and I were um 
270, eligible 
271, mhm 
272, Not in zone but eligible 
273, mhm 
274, nd u I knew of anybody he would be the one that would be deep
275, selected 
276, Well being uh buds with old Chuck Krulac didn t hurt things a
277, whole lot either laughing 
278, oh no 
279, Not at all 
280, nd you know when I ran into him uh in March it was at the 
281, lipsmack some symposium in San Diego a Nurse Corps thing 
282, yeah 
283, nd um dmiral Engel the Nurse Corps admiral was there 
284, nd 
285, You know arney knows her like they re best buds 
286, laughs 
287, So you know I m 
288, No more new pictures with vice president sons on stretchers 
289, uh no not yet laughs 
290, laughs I was expecting to see him taping up Socks or Chelsea any
291, day now 
292, Well it wouldn t surprise me either 
293, Emergency surgeon arney erens flown into the White House today 
294, He s he s talking about going to 
295, D C next 
296, ut 
297, mhm 
298, I guess you got to spend a year in San Diego for follow up 
299, yeah 
300, oh 
301, nd then uh after the whole episode called her back later didn t
302, remember it ever happened and said you know we got to g got to
303, get together sometime 
304, laughs oh jeez 
305, So I think this is what preempted Martha to uh 
306, ll her old beaus are definitely losing it 
307, I think it prompted her to get married 
308, I m trying to think if I ve got any other news inhales 
309, I hadn t been as much in touch 
310, with the other folks tha know Martha 
311, I usually am at least keeping abreast of things 
312, I think Pete and Jennifer 
313, still there you know she picked up lieutenant commander 
314, yeah I s I saw Jennifer at the same conference 
315, oh okay 
316, yeah 
317, Does she still look like a Teutonic uh pin up
