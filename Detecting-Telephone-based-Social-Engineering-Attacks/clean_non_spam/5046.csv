,0
0,the kind that if it s irregular all the time 
1, mm 
2, um evidently it causes it the possibility of causing a clot is very
3, high 
4, hm 
5, and so 
6, um they I don t quite understand if they re going to do this or not
7, 
8, but sometimes they administer a small shock to try and get it sort
9, of back on track 
10, mhm 
11, um so it gets back to a normal beat 
12, but otherwise you just try with drugs or something 
13, Well no what they do is they um 
14, give him drugs for an anti coagulant 
15, so that whatever clot was in there and caused that hopefully gets
16, dissolved 
17, mhm 
18, but then they you know they have to monitor that very closely
19, because for example 
20, a week and a half ago they said okay um you can t shave until we
21, see you again laughs 
22, well 
23, in other words you ll bleed to death if you uh 
24, lipsmack oh yeah right 
25, it 
26, See it s a very dangerous what s actually what s more dangerous is
27, that some sort of internal bleeding begins and 
28, you don t know about until you re dead so 
29, mhm 
30, yeah hm 
31, but they they cut him down to one checkup a week instead of two
32, which is 
33, mhm 
34, uh very promising 
35, yes 
36, and you know how it goes those little things I m sure you recall 
37, 
38, are very meaningful laughs 
39, yeah yeah absolutely I was at I was at a meeting yesterday and uh
40, 
41, that was the the something to do with the hospital and so we went
42, had fru we had lunch at the hospital 
43, mhm 
44, that s really weird going in to the hospital 
45, oh 
46, that must ve been very weird laughs 
47, yes but 
48, have you been to that hospital 
49, since xxx 
50, uh no no 
51, um but uh I ve been I you know I ve been looking at it for a while

58, of the building 
59, where I would walk uh you know things like that

77, you re a victim distorted 
78, yes horribly horribly horribly 
79, I m sorry 
80, lipsmack oh 
81, but now it s now it s over with now it s okay 
82, good 
83, good 
84, so uh now I can uh uh well 
85, eh start to feel normal again 
86, uhhuh how long do you get to feel normal again 
87, eh I I m not sure but anyway for the time being I m normal so it s
88, okay distortion 
89, uhhuh uhhuh 
90, you d say it s going through eh getting back to normal it seems
91, like going through your email 
92, uhhuh 
93, lipsmack and you know electronic mail 
94, and cleaning out the last two hundred messages that you had ignored
95, 
96, oh my god 
97, because you didn t have time to eh eh look at them 
98, oh my god that sounds like a nightmare laughs 
99, yes 
100, I come home to three messages on my answering machine and I 
101, yes distortion 
102, practically shut the thing off or 
103, inhales exactly so this is uh 
104, wish lightning would strike and just break it or something

126, 
127, you know we don t have much to compare well you have more because
128, you ve been there more but 
129, that s probably more than it s usually there and fiesta was just 
130, 
131, mhm 
132, that means I think 
133, half of Los ngeles went to Santa arbara for fiesta 
134, laughs 
135, but um it was fun anyway well it was I didn t care where I was
136, with Jesse if I just

164, you know stands where you can get all kinds of you know tacos and
165, this kind of thing and 
166, an clears throat sorry bands singing and stuff like that so

182, right they 
183, that s right that s right they were here

185, sometimes because I wanted to congratulate you on the cowboy boots
186, I heard that that would 
187, oh yeah boy are they cute they re that was so sweet of them you
188, know the 
189, Jesse had seen those six more than six months before that and
190, remembered which was amazing to me and I kept refusing to try them
191, on because I thought 
192, mhm 
193, you know why should I try them on they re two hundred dollars I m
194, not going to buy them but anyway she remembered so that was really
195, really sweet 
196, and um anyway I have them that was it was a fun visit
197, unfortunately 
198, that all happened with Josh s dad right when we were going to go
199, somewhere but 
200, um we had a fun time anyway exhale 
201, and some friends of mine were looking around um Portal you know
202, where Jesse did Jesse tell you where they went and stayed 
203, Well I don t remember that she said the name or anything just that
204, it was somewhere 
205, y 
206, yeah it s this place that s very special to them that they 
207, um told us about and we went and visited it before we even came
208, here 
209, xxx distortion mhm 
210, mhm 
211, and it s just this little 
212, beautiful canyon that looks like paradise the minute you walk into
213, it and 
214, they have little cabins for rent there and when Josh and I first
215, visited before we even moved here 
216, we both just went oh let s just 
217, buy one of those cabins and forget about it 
218, right just hang around the cabin distortion yeah 
219, forget about having a cafe laughs 
220, noise 
221, laughs 
222, We could have a cafe where 
223, one person a day comes and has a cup of coffee and 
224, yes laughs 
225, anyway it s really really pretty and 
226, evidently Michael had um 
227, actually Jesse went with him years and years ago 
228, when he was at U C L there s a research station up in this canyon
229, and and uh 
230, oh yeah because she had said to me that they didn t stay there they
231, wanted to to have something a bit more uh 
232, you know different yeah 
233, right anyway so that s how that spot 
234, came into the picture and they finally went there and stayed there
235, and had a wonderful time 
236, mm 
237, and some friends of mine who live here were looking at 
238, property for sale all over the place and that was one the places
239, they were looking in that particular area 
240, So I got them to give me their real estate map of where it was and
241, sent it to Jesse and Michael I hope laughs 
242, laughs 
243, hoping to uh and I put a little arrow that said you are here
244, hoping to egg them on so 
245, laughs 
246, mhm lipsmack 
247, Well at high time th they buy something similar so uh 
248, yeah well I you know I figure I mean it s none of my business and
249, you know it s hard to say what 
250, what people you know I asked I asked Jesse point blank you know can
251, you 
252, re you in the position to buy something right now with you know
253, the land here relatively speaking is really cheap I mean like five
254, hundred dollars an acre you know 
255, mhm distortion 
256, yeah distortion 
257, distortion 
258, yeah 
259, and she said yeah so I thought shit you know whatever happens 
260, distortion 
261, maybe they should just buy some land and you know if whatever they
262, can come and camp on it you know when they come to visit because
263, they don t like bed and breakfasts and 
264, yeah 
265, you know it s sometimes it s good when you have the money to get
266, the things you want because 
267, yeah well they ve been talking about getting getting places for a
268, long time and they just never get around to getting any place 
269, later on you know 
270, yeah I know well I think I mean I m just imagining you know what
271, their position is because it s I m sure it s it s very hard when
272, you re doing something and you 
273, yeah 
274, can t get out of it you know to do any anything 
275, No they won t but they but they can at least uh have some vacation
276, time or something 
277, right or you know whatever whatever happens in the future if you
278, buy some land y it s yours 
279, mhm 
280, you know I mean and the taxes on it are nothing I mean even if 
281, yeah 
282, and you can always sell it in in the worst cast you know 
283, yeah but now is the time because 
284, real estate is really going up around here now 
285, um southeastern rizona has gotten a lot of attention and 
286, uhhuh 
287, I think there s lots of urban refugee type stuff happening where
288, people are 
289, unhappy more and more with the city and they don t know what to do
290, or how to leave or how to make a living but a lot of people just
291, come here and go fuck it I ll figure something out you know 
292, So it s kind of a strange thing to be happening 
293, um 
294, Yes 
295, you know very sort of anti what we were all brought up to to do
296, laughs 
297, mhm 
298, y you know laughs 
299, kind of backwards of the merican dream where you get your career
300, and your little house and everything and 
301, anyway so I ve been trying to tempt them laughs So I told them
302, that we would go and look at this property if they wanted 
303, but um anyway 
304, yeah but the they also fixed the um the Christmas vacation
305, they re still uh 
306, End
307,
