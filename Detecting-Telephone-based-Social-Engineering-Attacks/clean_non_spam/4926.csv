254, anyway so I was not telling you about pappy so I told Shuki um he
255, he felt very bad about the way pappy s treating him 
256, terrible 
257, I know I felt so bad for him and he he was getting so upset about
258, it and he s telling me that 
259, I got all upset you know why 
260, because I messed it up even more 
261, I made a big mistake 
262, because Shuki had spoken to Taty 
263, xxx 
264, and Taty had said he s fed up with mommy this and that and that 
265, so Shuki came back and he told xxx ah 
266, Taty spoke to him and he was like all feeling bad for Taty 
267, and he sort of you know you see that s why 
268, and then later 
269, because mommy 
270, did not want to 
271, send 
272, tell me what Taty told Shuki you have to hear it from Shuki 
273, straight 
274, he s not telling me 
275, I couldn t imagine what Taty told him already 
276, yeah 
277, right 
278, so I called Shuki up 
279, yeah 
280, what did Taty tell you 
281, he s says nothing 
282, you just told me that you know you had enough and this and that
283, and it s very hard for him 
284, and the first thing that came out of my eyes ah my mouth was oh
285, how stupid 
286, why was ta Taty treating you so badly all the time like what
287, does that have to do with being fed up with mommy 
288, you re like when you re in it you don t see it and when you re
289, out of it you see straight through him 
290, do you know what I m saying 
291, but you think he was just looking for an excuse 
292, yeah 
293, he needed a reason sniff 
294, when did xxx 
295, ow I hurt myself 
296, when when did he tell this to Shuki 
297, before he Shuki went to xxx 
298, ah 
299, so I was very stupid because I should not have opened my mouth 
300, why am I looking to make more problems 
301, xxx 
302, but you know when something just slips out of because I just like
303, thought through the whole thi I was waiting for this major 
304, explanation Leeza built it up to who knows what 
305, I am not telling you you call Shuki that ah so and then when he
306, told me I like sort of laughed him in the face 
307, which was a mistake 
308, it was a big mistake 
309, but then so now Shuki s a 
310, but why is Leeza making an issue of it 
311, distortion 
312, why 
313, because Leeza likes to see mummy wrong 
314, Dear pappy had enough wh I told Leeza what kind of new story 
315, Taty had enough a long time ago 
316, right laughs 
317, what s so exciting about pappy had enough he s fed up maybe he
318, never thought of him that much but I have heard pappy say he s just
319, about had it 
320, many times 
321, but then he can t 
322, yeah well then he can t xxx but you know he s like a homemade 
323, right 
324, cartologist cartographer over here 
325, and you should just know that without telling Sh I don t know who
326, I could trust or whatever but 
327, I don t know I I I I believe very much what Rabbi Goldhaver said 
328, 
329, no I ll tell you why distortion 
330, because mommy told me mommy told me what goes on in the house 
331, yeah 
332, what 
333, ecause of Taty she says he she mommy was trying to tell me that
334, he is 
335, what 
336, he s very jealous and he can t stand xxx and xxx when he sees them
337, she told me straight out 
338, oh distorted 
339, she says you have to hear the comments that he says yo you know
340, what Sara 
341, it s our Rosh Hashanah and this is pure pure loshenhara s heb and
342, I want to stop right now or else I m going to be very upset 
343, okay I want to tell you something I want to tell you something to
344, correct everything 
345, he s against Shuki and xxx because he s a disagrees not because
346, distortion 
347, he has a very hard xxx 
348, not because he s jealous 
349, I think so 
350, not because he s jealous 
351, I want to tell you one thing that I told Shuki I am a I am not
352, for Taty he might have a lot of xxx but one think I want to tell
353, you that it takes 
354, he was always the forgiving type which is why I can t accept this
355, as whatever 
356, let me tell you something it takes a very selfish distortion it
357, takes a very selfish person 
358, to be jealous of their children 
359, there is no such thing 
360, yeah but you know what 
361, Well distortion but if there is 
362, Sara what why not you know what went on in my mind 
363, I don t even know if I should even open my mouth and say this 
364, but do you know when Taty stopped talking to me 
365, it happened when Shuki got engaged but do you know what else
366, happened 
367, I also bought a house and moved into it just then 
368, oh please tell oh distortion 
369, and he has not 
370, stepped into my house since and I ve got to convince now 
371, xxx I don t believe it I m totally not I m totally not believing
372, this 
373, I totally not 
374, and I want you to get this out of your head 
375, I don t know 
376, and I got it Sh out of out of Shuki s head because I want you to
377, know that if you think of it I took it apart I said Shuki 
378, End
379,
