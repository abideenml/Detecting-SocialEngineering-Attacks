151, yeah 
152, Right sniff anyway inhales um 
153, xxx 
154, So 
155, eh it was kind of upsetting because I had hoped that we could do
156, some other fun things together we didn t take 
157, i Dave was like we don t have the time and we don t have the money
158, 
159, mhm 
160, and you know it turns out he just doesn t want to spend any time
161, alone with me 
162, mhm 
163, laughs so he doesn t want to because he says it makes him too
164, anxious to go out with me 
165, So I said okay 
166, What am I going to do about this you know like what can I do how
167, can I take a toss okay what does he like to do okay he likes to
168, watch baseball on T V 
169, nd I hate it for years I always just go in the bedroom and read
170, when he does it in the summertime 
171, mhm 
172, ut I said okay I ll watch baseball with him 
173, So I sat there and you know what I realized 
174, Right 
175, I didn t really put it together over the Summer but he stopped
176, watching baseball 
177, lipsmack oh laughs 
178, Every other Summer we ve been together every single night he spent
179, watching baseball 
180, mhm 
181, nd as soon as I sit down and do it with him he stops 
182, mm 
183, mhm 
184, nyway so we didn t spend any time together and then we went to
185, England and his parents were really mean to me 
186, lipsmack oh 
187, nd Dave just said well because we split up I need to earn my way
188, back to the family 
189, mhm 
190, He said it s understandable that they should be angry with me 
191, because you took his son his son away from him 
192, What did I do I mean when I left with his son 
193, I don t I don t know 
194, Was with Dave s 
195, it was you know with his understanding 
196, mhm 
197, it was a supposedly an agreement we made together that he approved
198, of 
199, yeah 
200, So why are his parents punishing me 
201, hm 
202, They were really 
203, dreadful and then and very very cold 
204, lipsmack 
205, grunt 
206, nd you know I have just been so devoted and so loving I mean I m
207, taking this huge trip to go see them 
208, yeah 
209, as my only vacation we spent all of our money 
210, xxx 
211, to go do that 
212, you know 
213, nd they treat you like shit 
214, nd they treated me like shit and it was very upsetting 
215, thanks a lot 
216, and I don t believe 
217, nd Dave didn t stand up for me 
218, xxx 
219, You know what I mean 
220, mhm 
221, nd then afterwards everyone was very upset and he 
222, didn t 
223, you know say oh they were wrong to treat you that way 
224, You know nothing like that 
225, What was his reasoning 
226, Right well what is it distortion 
227, I mean he he says well they re mad at you and you know I mean h he
228, says it like 
229, you know because he s English so he doesn t spell it all out 
230, you know 
231, yeah 
232, ut he says it and leaves it open for me to infer that he agrees
233, with them 
234, mm 
235, nd then he doesn t contradict it 
236, breath You know and I say do you agree with them and he doesn t
237, say anything you know that kind of thing 
238, yeah yeah 
239, nd then um 
240, So they re coming for three weeks I m supposed to spend Christmas 
241, 
242, My Christmas vacation in Texas with them 
243, mhm 
244, They re coming for three weeks the only time that we both have free
245, 
246, mhm 
247, and meanwhile it s like he just ignores me 
248, when we re around them and I end up 
249, three of the days we were there he and his brother and his father
250, sat and watched cricket all day and I had to like 
251, clean the house and do the cooking and watch Sam 
252, breathes 
253, I know distortion 
254, mm 
255, You know it s incredible 
256, nd this is my only vacation 
257, yeah 
258, So I m supposed to spend my Christmas vacation which is the only
259, time I m going to get to see him 
260, yeah 
261, with them and I said I can t do it 
262, and um 
263, lipsmackThen I told him that I really wanted him to 
264, come 
265, up for Christmas 
266, mhm 
267, So we can all be together for Christmas and I just I just can t be
268, with them breath every time 
269, I mean I really struggled with it I really tried to get psyched
270, myself to do it 
271, every time I thought about it I d just burst into tears 
272, yeah 
273, You know I love Christmas and thing is that I loved these people 
274, 
275, mhm 
276, I really loved them and the fact that they could turn on me like
277, that showed me that they never really cared about me 
278, they obviously never approved of me 
279, or why would they be treating me like this 
280, No no I I think distortion 
281, They should be so happy that we re back together right 
282, yeah but probably they maybe at the time they took their son s side
283, and you know they thought oh my gosh you know she took the child
284, away and she hurt I mean 
285, Right 
286, Parents always take a boy s side they always take the you know 
287, I know I know but it s just really hurt that they could just turn
288, on me like that I mean I think that they should have seen that 
289, I m sure 
290, xxx 
291, you know maybe this was nobody s fault maybe it was both of our
292, faults and certainly they should be very happy for all of us that
293, we re together again and support us 
294, bsolutely 
295, Instead of 
296, Did you try talking to them 
297, punishing me 
298, No because I didn t really realize what was going on when we were
299, there I just knew I was feeling bad 
300, yeah 
301, nd because they re so indirect 
302, mhm 
303, They have this weird English oh no we re nice and polite 
304, yeah yeah yeah but meanwhile cold like ice 
305, yeah 
306, exactly 
307, yeah 
308, exactly 
309, So it was very hard to put it together and Dave was the one I
310, thought that they were being very breath 
311, lipsmack 
312, um disapproving of Sam but Dave was the one who told me no it was
313, me 
314, I mean most the stuff I m getting about them I m getting from him 
315, 
316, oh 
317, So I don t even know like what is he just trying to make me feel
318, bad you know what I mean 
319, yeah 
320, but I think that it s true I mean at some time he could be doing
321, things to help keep me from feeling so bad 
322, You know 
323, m mhm 
324, Like he doesn t have to tell me all these things I think he really
325, wanted me to feel bad breath he really wanted me to be punished 
326, 
327, mhm 
328, You know and and what did I do I mean I was the one who got us back
329, together and I 
330, bent over backwards to make the relationship work I ve done 
331, everything he said I was doing wrong that was keeping him from
332, being happy 
333, Well 
334, nah it doesn t work that way 
335, hm I know it doesn t but you know it s like uch s heb it s just all
336, a mess and it s disgusting 
337, ut anyway so that s been the most recent 
338, So what how do you feel about them is it okay now it s okay 
339, lipsmack xxx 
340, How are you handling all this stuff 
341, breath I you know I feel 
342, completely broken hearted heartbroken and devastated laughs 
343, 
344, inhales 
345, yeah well 
346, I really do I feel like I have put my life into this relationship 
347, 
348, I spent seven years with him I had a child with him 
349, mhm 
350, You know I ve devoted myself to him 
351, and um 
352, I don t know I just I had so much invested in this 
353, you know 
354, yeah yup 
355, I just feel like I don t know if I can ever really recover from it
356, 
357, because it s just been such a enormous colossal failure 
358, You know 
359, Well then why force it maybe it s going to be better with somebody
360, else 
361, oh no we re not I mean 
362, yeah 
363, yeah no no 
364, because actually I I know him Sara I ve done nine and half years
365, with Gabe 
366, yeah that s right 
367, and it really does feel like xxx I have done nothing to change him
368, 
369, lipsmack I know 
370, You know I ve been trying to help him fix him but I said to him you
371, know what 
372, you a you re a typical Hungarian male 
373, End
374,
