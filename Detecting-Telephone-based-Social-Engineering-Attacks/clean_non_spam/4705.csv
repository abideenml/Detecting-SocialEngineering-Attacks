,0
0,nd um the Jesuit who explained that to me said this is nothing
1, against 
2, other programs that are very very wonderful you know where they
3, give service for service s sake 
4, mhm 
5, but it s just that this thing is because of a conversion or
6, because of their friendship with Christ voices 
7, mhm 
8, in wanting to collaborate with that project you know 
9, mhm 
10, and the second one is that you live in the same poor area where
11, you re going to work 
12, mhm 
13, Now let me say that I have seen you know that this very I I took it
14, literally 
15, and I th you know I said to Jackie this is very important and we
16, didn t take some people because of that 
17, mhm 
18, You know in fact one Jewish gal that she was just crazy about and
19, was very very dynamic and knew Spanish and everything 
20, breath but I said Jackie how will we say she s doing this out of
21, a commitment to Christ 
22, mhm 
23, You know I mean I can t say that to say I ll agree and this is my
24, commit breath but 
25, I have also found that as in all things human it is it is not
26, perfectly kept down here 
27, mhm 
28, uh I mean w I ve met other volunteers who are you know from Spain
29, and everything breath 
30, mhm 
31, but I sai uh but anyway I would like to still keep that 
32, a and not change that with Jackie 
33, mhm 
34, and I think 
35, mhm 
36, it may might be im it would be important that people knew that 
37, 
38, lipsmack oh this is great 
39, Well I mean it is great for me I m I m using your phone call here 
40, 
41, uhhuh 
42, Well I am delighted 
43, oh great 
44, Well just tell me a little bit about your apostolate because you
45, said to me in your in your 
46, letter now pray for my apostolate too breath do you mean with the
47, girls 
48, Well basically in the college 
49, yeah 
50, um but uh I there are a couple things that I wanted to be sure to
51, mention to you 
52, yeah 
53, One is that um Isabelle was one of four women who made the
54, centering prayer retreat 
55, okay I read that sure in your letter okay 
56, nd another one was named Guadalupe otherwise known as Lupita 
57, okay 
58, nd apparently she sometimes she teaches about third grade maybe 
59, 
60, yeah 
61, nd sometimes she brings the children to this fe s spa
62, alegria s spa where you are 
63, oh okay 
64, So you may meet her 
65, oh okay 
66, Now 
67, Guadalupe and she s called Lupita 
68, Lupita 
69, yeah okay 
70, Now at the end of the retreat we had a little sharing session 
71, Yes 
72, nd she began to speak and she became a little bit emotional 
73, yeah 
74, nd she said she really wished she could talk more about her
75, experience but she couldn t because she was more comfortable in
76, Spanish 
77, yeah okay 
78, nd so when I said goodbye to her and everything I you know sh she
79, spoke as if she would be meeting you a at some time 
80, yeah okay 
81, nd I told her um I didn t I wasn t setting you up to be a
82, spiritual director or anything laughs breath but I did say to
83, her that 
84, if she were to talk if she felt that she wanted to talk about her
85, prayer experience in Spanish breath that you would probably be
86, able to 
87, certainly to understand her but to empathize a little bit with what
88, she was experiencing 
89, oh sure yeah yeah 
90, So I wanted to tell you that I said that um 
91, okay now do do did you give me her number in that letter 
92, I don t think so 
93, No okay but Isabelle would know it because 
94, Yes 
95, they went together 
96, yeah okay 
97, n and she seems t eh uh I think maybe when the school year
98, starts or something 
99, yeah 
100, Lupita will be up there with her students doing a service
101, project or I don t know just what it is 
102, okay 
103, that they do 
104, yeah static okay 
105, ut 
106, xxx the there are many fe s spa alegria s spa centers 
107, uhhuh 
108, so it s possible that she works in one and not the one I am in 
109, 
110, oh 
111, ut b b but the thing is with Isabelle I can get in touch with
112, her 
113, uhhuh 
114, yeah 
115, uhhuh 
116, So that s fine 
117, mhm 
118, yeah 
119, Then the other thing I wanted to mention to you is um with respect
120, to my niece and my nephew 
121, yeah 
122, My nephew s name is Jeff McDougal 
123, yeah 
124, He made his vows in the Jesuits a year ago 
125, You said that 
126, I I couldn t remember if I did or not 
127, Yes 
128, nd so he spent uh th a portion of the summer in Mexico 
129, yeah 
130, nd then went to El Salvador after he finished his summer school
131, courses 
132, okay 
133, Now I don t know if he will come back again 
134, I have a feeling he will 
135, probably spend a good portion of his life somewhere in mm in one of
136, the Central 
137, yeah 
138, merican or South merican countries 
139, yeah 
140, but if you should meet him I know you ll keep an eye on him or
141, 
142, oh yes 
143, something 
144, yeah Jeff McDougal 
145, uhhuh 
146, that s neat 
147, uhhuh 
148, yeah 
149, nd then my niece nne um maybe you won t meet her because even
150, though she s raised Catholic and all that 
151, yeah 
152, Right now she doesn t want to associate herself with any kind of a
153, religious service project although she s very interested in 
154, something like what you re doing 
155, yeah yeah 
156, um so we ll see what happens on that 
157, Where is she living

161, yeah

164, she s kind of going through um conversion life changing
165, experience and 
166, xxx yeah yeah 
167, and when she a when she s all done I mean I I know she s moving
168, toward a simpler lifestyle and a life of service and 
169, yeah 
170, how much God is going to be in the picture and not it 
171, oh 
172, remains to be seen 
173, yeah
