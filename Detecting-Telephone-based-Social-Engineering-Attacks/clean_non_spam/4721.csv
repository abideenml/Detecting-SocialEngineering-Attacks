1, yeah until like you find something that 
2, that isn t stressful or and not boring 
3, yeah 
4, that s the main two combinations right 
5, yeah 
6, Not stressful and not boring laughs 
7, yeah 
8, Well it s like I have no problems with secretarial work okay that s
9, what fitted in to that category because if you are a busy enough
10, secretary you know eh 
11, mm 
12, y you don t get bored because you are always doing something
13, different 
14, and if your employer is a relatively decent human being you know
15, two if s there 
16, mhm 
17, breath but you get no respect I mean oh you re a secretary and
18, the pay is pretty pretty crummy 
19, breathit s about the well it s pretty much the same as as what
20, I m getting you know but breath 
21, um depending upon where you work and all but you know it s like
22, sigh that s no answer either so breath 
23, I ve just been toying with this idea of going back to school and
24, getting a computer science degree so I can always be gainfully
25, employed 
26, ut anyway laugh 
27, a and you can think about that pregnancy thing laughs 
28, oh yeah that pregnancy thing yeah that do the 
29, laughs Maybe that s your there s your hormones calling laugh 
30, yeah well no the funny thing is it s like 
31, ten years ago I would ve said oh yeah that was what I really wanted
32, to be doing is having a baby 
33, you know but like at this point in time it s kind of like we re
34, going to do it because if we don t do it 
35, uh 
36, breath eh you know in the next year or two we d regret it 
37, you know we we figure it s something we d want to do it s not like
38, we re doing it because we have to do it or there s peer pressure or
39, well a little 
40, mm 
41, little peer pressure laughs 
42, oh no no no 
43, I yea I know exactly where you re at because I think about that
44, too I got about like six or seven years 
45, I figure my body is a very slow um 
46, yeah 
47, maturer you know what I mean like I didn t get my period until I
48, was sixteen I don t look 
49, yeah mm 
50, e I mean I look like about uh uh at least five or six years
51, younger than I actually am breath 
52, and I m just starting to get my period actually now laughs 
53, 
54, yeah yeah 
55, laughs 
56, as an adult breath So I kind of figure well I must I I m probably
57, I m probably good until at least some time in the early forties and
58, I 
59, could probably go a little longer than that I know there s a risk
60, and all that bullshit breath 
61, yeah 
62, but um yeah I think about that too because it s like I mean I I
63, kind of like the way things are going in the in the total lack of
64, responsibility television 
65, I know well I mean that s the thing kids are cute and all that and
66, I was just we we 
67, mm 
68, slept until noon we got up about ten and was like oh we have to get
69, out of bed played with the cats 
70, fell back to sleep okay I mean we re talking total slackers 
71, mm 
72, breath and I thought gee you know if we had a kid w we couldn t
73, do this laughs you know and 
74, mm 
75, No you got to be focused on that and I wa I mean there s a lots of
76, other things that 
77, breath I mean as far as like living situation I I was feeling
78, kind of settled you know like 
79, Right 
80, I m not going to be like 
81, traipsing around but 
82, I mean I could say that for the next five or even eight or maybe 
83, y yeah 
84, ten years alright ev even if I could project that far which I
85, really can t 
86, yeah 
87, but I mean you got a kid you can t do fucking ten years w 
88, I know 
89, it s like cool I think I ll go off to the Orient and start like
90, bouncing from country country 
91, I know well and I mean okay Emory wants to get his doctorate so
92, we ll know next Spring if he can get at least accepted into the
93, program which hopefully 
94, mm 
95, you know and then then there s four or five years doing the damn
96, work and laughs 
97, mm 
98, He s crazy he wants it that s fine he can do it no problem breath
99, but um that sort of ties us up here 
100, although we like the place we re in no hurry to leave it 
101, yeah 
102, and that would be good 
103, ut then you know what if he could get a position overseas again
104, which is something both of us have said would be 
105, pretty darn good because 
106, mm 
107, um you know we re a after after coming back from Spain from
108, those two and half years 
109, xxx it wasn t so much an adjustment to the way things were it s
110, just 
111, asking the question gee do we really like 
112, um the way things are over here with 
113, the lifestyle the nine to five kind of thing I mean I m really in
114, the nine to five thing more so than he is 
115, he you know he should be there by breath oh 
116, oh noise well let s say eight thirty to nine 
117, xxx 
118, but yeah 
119, xxx he doesn t care when 
120, well okay um and his professor is noise 
121, obviously uh uh a great person to work for so I m I m envious but
122, um 
123, whatever I m you know I m caught up 
124, mm 
125, in it and and I don t like it you know laughs breath 
126, too many days I m I m working and and eating at my desk at about
127, twelve o clock and I m thinking 
128, mm 
129, This is crazy you know in Spain uh we had this 
130, break laughs and you sat you talked to people you know you
131, enjoyed your food you relaxed 
132, mm 
133, you know 
134, and it s a fairly productive nation right you know laughs What s
135, going on here laughs xxx 
136, yeah you have to yeah 
137, I mean you have to like look at like both ad I mean they both
138, music have the advantages and disadvantages what you have to do is
139, concentrate on the advantages 
140, in what oth ever place you re in 
141, mhm 
142, and think about the disadvantages of the place that you re not
143, in 
144, yeah 
145, Otherwise you go nuts right 
146, That s true yeah 
147, yeah 
148, I know Laura tried to uh because we have email and and so she sent
149, me a letter back saying 
150, you know remember how crowded the transportation is and uh what
151, else 
152, mm 
153, how expensive everything is 
154, breath and uh breath I you know I remember those things of
155, course you know 
156, nd you work you know possibilities were a lot more limited 
157, True 
158, and the language you know 
159, yeah 
160, constantly like kind of like I mean those could be p considered
161, positive things as well 
162, yeah 
163, but I mean you mind as well think of them in a negative vie rather
164, than 
165, mhm sure 
166, They just like breath worrying over them 
167, Well you know 
168, and that s why I m I I 
169, it helps to have 
170, kind of a glimpse into the future right 
171, nd that s how that s how we got to 
172, mm 
173, Spain in the first place is we said we wanted to live abroad and
174, we would try to do it you know as teachers and it turned out that
175, way because 
176, mm 
177, we had this idea of and I I really feel that that s important
178, breath and 
179, so what I m having an idea of now is 
180, okay you know Emory works on his doctorate it takes about five or
181, six years 
182, we have the kid probably 
183, we he gets a research position 
184, somewhere in France or in Spain um 
185, and then we move over there and you know 
186, I take care of the kid and and 
187, do some you know little day labor whatever you know we ll see
188, laughs 
189, mm 
190, um and we have relatively mellow life for who knows five or ten
191, years and then we take it from there 
192, lipsmack yeah because even like you know I mean all that stuff
193, right is is all so subject to 
194, whatever change in the weather laughs that happens to be right 
195, mhm 
196, oh I know I know 
197, nd and it s like 
198, you know what I think because I get like the same I get the same as
199, you like some days it s just kind of like 
200, you know what the hell am I doing not not with my life but ge but
201, I mean just what 
202, yeah 
203, you know like what like where do I get the animal to to just you
204, know 
205, to do anything you know xxx I just lay in bed and dream for for the
206, whole day easily 
207, yeah 
208, I know 
209, Well 
210, I I know I know what you re saying I I feel there s sort of a 
211, a line to cross too between really planning it out and worry and
212, stressing over it because 
213, for a while a couple months back there I was thinking in terms of
214, oh gosh you know can we ever afford a house 
215, mm 
216, and then we sat down and sort of looked at it financially and said
217, 
218, is this what we really want to be worrying about right now and you
219, know I realize no 
220, yeah absolutely 
221, and and so you know you can sort of focus too much on the future or
222, I I know I have this tendency to do that 
223, nd miss the present completely I mean miss like you know the smell
224, of the goddamn onions frying in the pan 
225, yeah 
226, yeah yeah 
227, you know and e each little breath I mean i it s like as far as
228, I m concerned 
229, com music in background 
230, there s like no pleasure that s as intense as the one that you are
231, experiencing at that moment you know you can think about what
232, something might be like or reminisce about 
233, the past but like when you re there in that moment 
234, it s I mean everything else just kind of like it s almost like time
235, doesn t exist 
236, yeah 
237, You know xxx yeah 
238, Well 
239, I I know one of the best moments I can recall in these past two
240, months is 
241, okay I get the late I get to work a little bit late which is common
242, and they don t really care since I m an hourly you know you have to
243, be within a certain time frame 
244, mm 
245, and so everyone else is parked 
246, I m way out there in the parking lot closer to where the trees are
247, 
248, and I you know I close the door I just take a deep breath laugh
249, as I go okay another day 
250, and I hear the birds singing 
251, yeah 
252, and I just stop for a minute and listen to the birds and that s
253, that it sort of cheers me up it I you know I realize what a minute
254, okay 
255, in that nasty sterile office where the windows don t even open 
256, 
257, music 
258, eh um I will be for the next eight hours or so but out here there
259, still is some life going on and just sort of cheers me up to know
260, that 
261, okay I can come back to it you know laughs So breath that s
262, that s xxx 
263, yeah in that moment I mean nobody is going to like interfere with
264, that at all 
265, There you are you and the birds you know music 
266, yeah 
267, yeah yup lipsmack hey we can find good Spanish wine over here
268, speaking of the moment laughs you know 
269, oh yeah 
270, breath nd every once in a while when you know I can I can
271, remember 
272, laughs 
273, just being back um with people or or eating some place you know in
274, arcelona and uh 
275, so it brings me back but 
276, I still haven t gone to that fresh French restaurant by your house
277, 
278, um 
279, I m like dying to go there 
280, You mean the one right next to the apartment 
281, yeah yeah yeah 
282, Well it s not French it s just it s just gourmet it s gourmet
283, Catalan 
284, oh it s not oh I thought it was Fre ah really 
285, yeah yeah 
286, Well even better 
287, Save it for save it for a special occasion you know and and you
288, know you might need a reservation too yeah um 
289, yeah 
290, I will 
291, I should have some some visitors and my family s planning on coming
292, this summer so I ll take them there and this fondue place I wanted
293, to take them to also 
294, yeah yeah 
295, Is the one over in Gracia that it s kind of on a corner I think I
296, think I 
297, uh 
298, no there s a couple places in Gracia that I ve been going to 
299, uhhuh 
300, ut uh there s one in the um breath ario Gottigo actually it s
301, on the other side of Leotana 
302, huh 
303, Like down over by the ornillo 
304, okay 
305, nd it s got I ve only been there I ve only eaten there once
306, alright but I ve been in a million times because every time I pass
307, with somebody I have to show them the place 
308, uhhuh 
309, ctually you know I know where I m going to go I have a friend my
310, friend from England I don t remember if I I told you about her she s
311, my my old um roommate 
312, mhm 
313, From Oviato breath and she s coming she got a job down here she s
314, coming on Friday to live 
315, mhm 
316, nd ah I this is like the perfect because when we lived in Ovia 
317, Oviato we used to go to this fondue place all the time that
318, would be the f perfect place to take her when she gets her 
319, yeah 
320, yeah 
321, We well I m glad to hear that you got a job that you like and and
322, uh um think that you wer you were able to stay that was I was a
323, little bit worried a at first 
324, breath you know that when you got back there because the th the
325, money would run out probably in pril or so and breath you know 
326, 
327, yeah 
328, nd I knew you know I knew I d get a job right I I mean I knew I
329, would get a job but 
330, a and I after I just stopped thinking about it I just started th 
331, thought well fuck it I am going it s like inevitable and I m I m
332, going to get some I want something I have to get something and I
333, will 
334, uhhuh 
335, um huh 
336, ut I didn t say I I just thought that you know I ll get a job and
337, at this point if I get desperate I ll just have to take anything 
338, yeah 
339, nd the fact that I like kind of fell into something that s 
340, Fairly sweet I mean eh in the beginning everything kind of starts
341, out nice but I m changing my attitude to the point where 
342, breath I m not going to get stressed out about it too much 
343, I m not going to try to change anything 
344, Good laughs 
345, I m going to go in there I m going to do a nice job I m going to
346, have a good time 
347, uhhuh 
348, you know i and I m not going to breath I mean it s not the
349, same I m either like from working with kids I mean that was
350, like you know my my career for like eight years 
351, mhm 
352, ut this is you know more like 
353, it s nice it s really nice distortion 
354, nd you could 
355, Well and you can always go back to that if you wanted to you know
356, working at least in the 
357, States or maybe eventually once you have your residency yeah you
358, can work in some some place in Spain too with with l ah 
359, yeah 
360, yeah I don t have a big draw for it right now if anything like I
361, would like to open a bi I ve always wanted to have like a bar or a
362, restaurant I mean it takes tons distortion of money 
363, yeah 
364, yeah me too well laughs breath well 
365, ut like I d love to 
366, That s why I want to win win the lottery first though because it s
367, like you ha 
368, laughs 
369, Or to have enough background money to set that kind of thing up
370, distortion breath but um 
371, well yeah well um good and and so you re you re probably not going
372, to come back Christmas which is cool Emory was telling me that so 
373, 
374, yeah and I probably won t distortion 
375, End
376,
