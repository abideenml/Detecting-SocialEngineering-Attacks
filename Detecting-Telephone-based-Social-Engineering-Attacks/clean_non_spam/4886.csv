100, Is it that he doesn t have a viable product or he d or he doesn t
101, have a via 
102, I think he has viable product eh there s a few things breath I
103, think he has a viable product but I think that he s not like a
104, fundraiser or organizer type 
105, mhm 
106, mhm 
107, um and I think that like from the beginning if he had had a person
108, that was like that kind of type with him 
109, breath 
110, then they would have been okay but 
111, Right 
112, like the truth is is that all the people that worked with them
113, initially breath were like Da like you know were like Danny and
114, they 
115, mhm 
116, You mean the sort of xxx you mean xxx not 
117, You know cre yeah active creative and all that but not like the
118, the do practical down to earth uh breath you know money ma and
119, like you know 
120, ut not practical as far as the 
121, Well may eh may maybe k dai s heb to hire a money minded guy for
122, this 
123, aggre 
124, So you know what I mean 
125, yeah so the problem is though that 
126, s opposed to as opposed to xxx 
127, they re so beyond like you know they re so beyond it financially
128, now that they can t hire anybody breath 
129, mhm 
130, So um 
131, Well he ll have to he ll have to so to speak um raise his own
132, salary 
133, I mean 
134, breath Well that s what s yeah that s what s happening but it s
135, very very shver s yid so like you know breath 
136, xxx 
137, Right 
138, What yeah th a little bit comes in here a little bit comes in
139, there you know 
140, mm 
141, ut uh like in a lot of the thi the people that you know we
142, approached in Toronto 
143, mhm 
144, They like promise and then people don t follow through and you
145, know 
146, Sure 
147, You always have to f follow up is one of the things you know 
148, yeah no but like even when you follow up and then they say well you
149, know we re going to be in Israel like after the Chagim 
150, nd breath you know like thanks a lot 
151, Like 
152, mm 
153, xxx 
154, breath 
155, Right 
156, nd and and yeah well we d like to you know start a project 
157, in a few months from now laughs Like breath So in the meantime
158, and a lot of the he you know couldn t afford to keep on a lot of the
159, staff 
160, and so the lo lipsmack 
161, mhm 
162, a lot of staff have left and and so he s there on his own with all
163, this stuff he s uh 
164, uhhuh so so it s a nightmare 
165, Very very very diff 
166, breath It was very difficult 
167, So he s he s struggling like crazy 
168, breath 
169, asically 
170, xxx 
171, nd uh you know then on top of it he s like he s in the middle of
172, nowhere here stranded like uh breath 
173, Right so that 
174, We thought that it was every half hour 
175, We re right near Kiryat Sefer so like everybody s telling us that
176, these buses from Kiryat Sefer go out every half hour and you know
177, breath 
178, xxx 
179, being more and more service but it s like every half hour during
180, rush hour like eight and five 
181, ut breath 
182, xxx 
183, for like three for an hour or two at a time like but you know that
184, you can have stretches of the day where like for three hours there s
185, no bus 
186, There s no bus so it can be real pain 
187, So yeah and then like until you get 
188, the the bus goes through Kiryat Sefer and then it goes into Geula 
189, Like until you get into Yerushalayim it s like an hour 
190, Right so 
191, Not forty minutes 
192, So it s a lot of time 
193, and then yeah 
194, nd then like if you re well Danny doesn t have to g the truth is
195, Danny you know is in town so it s not such a big deal to get from
196, Geula to town 
197, ut um 
198, Right that s xxx 
199, It s only a five minute walk 
200, ut for me like it s like to get from Har Nof after that 
201, Pain 
202, You have to take xxx that bus whatever 
203, Pain in the neck 
204, It s like an hour and a half you know just 
205, uhhuh 
206, So uh so that s a real and then you also have to go and walk into
207, Kiryat Sefer 
208, Like it s also a walk 
209, Like a fifteen twenty minute walk in the blistering sun breath 
210, 
211, So um 
212, So it s not easy 
213, s far as that goes you mean commuting goes it s really not ea 
214, commuting goes it s not easy 
215, Like now I m trying to get uh breath it s also the beginning you
216, don t know your way around 
217, yeah I mean I guess you re going to f once your life will take on
218, some semblance of routine 
219, it ll b e things will get easier because 
220, Well you have to what you have to do is you have to be in the know
221, like you have to find out about you know who goes in when and 
222, Who goes rides and this and that r 
223, breath tramps and all that 
224, yeah so I just found out a a ride that goes at like seven ten in
225, the morning like I can g get to work with it breath 
226, mhm 
227, So you know and Danny s found something like three times a week uh
228, like a ride in at the time he needs to get breath like so 
229, uhhuh 
230, I think with time a lot of these things would 
231, With time things a lot of you ll be able to iron out some of the
232, kinks 
233, Right right 
234, It s just this 
235, So to speak 
236, Just uh you know until then it s like a it s 
237, mhm 
238, It s crazy a little bit 
239, uhhuh 
240, So uh yeah so then like you know there s a lot of things stupid
241, things like breath there s no screens on the windows and it s like
242, full of mosquitoes and wasps 
243, So all the bugs come in 
244, and the hornets and 
245, nd and probably to buy screens costs who knows how much 
246, yeah 
247, Then you h to make you know you have to make the aluminum for the
248, whole thing 
249, Like you have to breath I haven t gotten a coat yet 
250, I m sort of afraid to 
251, mhm 
252, breath 
253, ut like Danny goes crazy with these things 
254, He hates 
255, 
256, exp something hitting table 
257, He hates bugs 
258, bugs 
259, Whatever you know like breath 
260, mm huh 
261, So he bought some screen up in like in the hardware st 
262, store and just like taped 
263, ut you know it keeps on coming out and whatever 
264, Right 
265, xxx oh man 
266, Not something xxx 
267, nd you know so these kind of and and 
268, ll the little logistical things that hopefully with time will get
269, ironed up at this point they re they re real xxx 
270, They drive you crazy 
271, We re also in the shfelah s heb here 
272, Like we re around w we re very uh
