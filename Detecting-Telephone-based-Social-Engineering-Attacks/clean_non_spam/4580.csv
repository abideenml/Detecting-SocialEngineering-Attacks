1, there s nothing that it s like someone smoking or any other
2, addiction 
3, that 
4, xxx the 
5, addict has to be willing and and want to give it up 
6, but I mean it wasn t like we ever showed up at their house or they
7, showed up at our house and he was drunk you know 
8, right 
9, he wasn t 
10, right 
11, he acted normal he always acted normal when he left 
12, mhm 
13, no it wasn t like he was falling over 
14, right 
15, you know like Mike s friend Jimmy 
16, it was obvious 
17, hm distorted 
18, yeah 
19, he couldn t handle his liquor you know and 
20, it was obvious 
21, right 
22, from the beginning and he you know 
23, he drank 
24, ten beers at a shot 
25, yeah 
26, well there are some alcoholics who are able to conceal it better
27, than others who 
28, you know 
29, takes more to affect them 
30, so that it s obvious to others 
31, hm 
32, oh it explains a lot of the odd behavior 
33, eh you know like Jane would say that 
34, he he took a lot of sick days 
35, mhm 
36, and 
37, she sai i 
38, I don t know 
39, you know it s just like I can t understand why she never told me 
40, 
41, all this time 
42, well that s uh that s something that s very hard to share with
43, anybody and it s the kind of thing you really 
44, oh we re such close friends though but I mean you know up until 
45, yeah 
46, two months ago we re still going over each others we just didn t do
47, it much this summer 
48, mhm 
49, but you know we d go to their house and they d open up a bottle of
50, wine 
51, mhm 
52, you know why continue if they re going to lcohols nonymous for
53, five years 
54, yeah 
55, why do that with close friends 
56, right then don t serve it sure 
57, or don t serve it or 
58, say you know I m not we would ve sort of gotten the clue 
59, mhm mhm 
60, after a while when they didn t want to drink any wine at our house
61, or 
62, sure 
63, you know he didn t have to say it 
64, but why continue serving it at dinner 
65, right 
66, yeah that s just a part 
67, to everybody 
68, right 
69, you know 
70, right that s a strange thing that they continue to serve it and 
71, you know 
72, you know Kim Joy Humphries eh what became an alcoholic
73, clears throat 
74, and uh the last time he came to our house 
75, as they walked in she walked in first and erl stopped me at the
76, door he said uh 
77, don t serve any li any liquor 
78, don t even offer it 
79, yeah 
80, so you know that 
81, yeah 
82, I mean we re 
83, friendly with Jimmy and we don t drink around him 
84, right 
85, you know we don t have anything he doesn t have anything 
86, mhm 
87, mhm 
88, why tempt him you know we re not going to sit here and have a beer
89, in front of him he can t drink 
90, yeah 
91, sure 
92, right right 
93, why wouldn t they 
94, tell us to try to help them with this pro you know 
95, yeah 
96, who knows but 
97, I don t know 
98, that they re I guess they f probably felt it was a terrible 
99, shame and disgrace and maybe it was just 
100, but that s foolish because you certainly should 
101, share these things with your friends so that they can help you with
102, it rather than 
103, continue to 
104, use it and abuse it you know 
105, ha 
106, I m sorry to hear that 
107, I hope certainly hope he ll make it 
108, but xxx said you know like he used to take sick days all the time 
109, 
110, mhm 
111, he he s been doing this f forever 
112, yeah 
113, and um 
114, she said oh he seems to catch everything the kids get 
115, mhm 
116, I mean whatever she didn t realize that he was 
117, yeah 
118, you know 
119, honey 
120, wha xxx you just deny it to yourself too 
121, but 
122, yeah I mean I was up there last week with her 
123, coughs 
124, in New Hampshire 
125, mhm 
126, and it s she said you know I ve been counting up the number of sick
127, days that Gary has taken since the beginning of the year he s taken
128, twelve sick days 
129, mm 
130, and he always took sick days when she was working and the kids were
131, at day care 
132, mhm 
133, mm 
134, and I you know I m thinking to myself gee he must really need 
135, a break 
136, yeah 
137, you know maybe he just wants the house to himself and can t
138, tolerate 
139, mhm 
140, you know 
141, having to go to work and always have people around having to be
142, home and always have p you know maybe he just needs days 
143, mhm 
144, to himself maybe this is just too much 
145, you know three kids is too much for him or something I m thinking
146, i 
147, right 
148, family stress I didn t think it was 
149, mhm 
150, because he was drinking or hung over or 
151, right 
152, whatever 
153, right 
154, yeah that 
155, it s not the kind of thing that pops into y into your mind as as
156, being a fairly common 
157, although I m sure it s much more common 
158, than what 
159, we all know 
160, but 
161, it isn t the first thing that you think about when you hear about
162, someone 
163, taking sick days you think they re sick 
164, mm 
165, oh she always used to complain that he worked till nine o clock at
166, night and Mike and I used to say boy he you know 
167, mhm 
168, what s going on that he can t manage his work load 
169, mhm 
170, you know if he s there from ni how can anyone work from nine in
171, the morning till nine at night five days a week 
172, mhm yeah 
173, and get home at ten o clock we re like you know 
174, right 
175, obviously 
176, either can t manage his work load or 
177, mhm 
178, you know we just couldn t understand it 
179, yeah 
180, but 
181, he was probably going 
182, he was probably going out drinking 
183, to a bar 
184, yeah 
185, yeah 
186, so maybe she didn t know 
187, mhm 
188, you know 
189, right 
190, I mean she knew enough to know he was an alcoholic and to 
191, have him get help 
192, mhm 
193, and to go to l and she said you know lately it s gotten so bad
194, that he was 
195, seeing one on one a 
196, therapist 
197, mhm 
198, but 
199, I don t know it s they said the next forty eight hours is critical
200, 
201, oh dear that s really a shame 
202, oh we re just hoping he makes it through 
203, sure 
204, sure 
205, is he around your age 
206, or is he older 
207, yeah thirty nine 
208, mm 
209, yeah that s really rough 
210, yeah 
211, lipsmack

213, it s not like he s Mickey Mantle on sixty three 
214, well 
215, hm

218, yeah
