0,So anyway how are you doing these days 
1, Things are going very well 
2, I think I had mentioned before that um that uh that uh that
3, there s a company now that I m working with 
4, um uh which is very much just just myself and Guss 
5, oh 
6, nd that um 
7, No you hadn t mentioned that 
8, eh oh okay 
9, okay so um 
10, eh you told me that you were leaving the company that you were at 
11, and you were entertaining offers 
12, nd uh 
13, Well i well it seemed to make sense since I had a client to to
14, just kind of set up my own company of sorts 
15, So um 
16, oh 
17, So things are going extremely well 
18, So I had one client who said that he d pay me a minimum amount 
19, You know he d he uh there would be a minimum amount of work of
20, about uh a day a week for the next two three years 
21, mhm 
22, Which is sufficient to pay all my bills then so I decided that it
23, would make sense to do this 
24, nd um 
25, and um I ve been getting substantially more work than then 
26, mm 
27, So I m quite pleased quite pleased 
28, Well that s good 
29, So um so I have a bunch of uh work that I need to do on my flat
30, this year 
31, I ve been telling you that I needed to do that roof atrium for
32, quite some time 
33, ut it should uh it should come out this year 
34, oh well that s good 
35, It should be done in a few months 
36, oh yeah I remember 
37, lipsmack So 
38, you talking a little bit about it at one point 
39, yeah yeah 
40, So you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon 
41, um 
42, I don t see the finances occurring 
43, uhhuh right 
44, for a while 
45, um actually right at the moment finances are not going real well 
46, ut 
47, ah well 
48, I am working on that one 
49, uh 
50, inhales It s just 
51, ut um 
52, uh uh the the the main reason for that is I had not really
53, anticipated a few expenses that recently came up 
54, ah 
55, uh related to a couple of burglaries that I had 
56, oh harsh 
57, Harsh 
58, yeah 
59, yeah but and 
60, Not a whole lot I can do about that now 
61, Indeed 
62, Indeed 
63, have to deal with the situation 
64, nd 
65, So that s what I m doing 
66, Sounds good 
67, ut um 
68, nyway uh 
69, One of the main reasons that I ve been such a pathetic uh 
70, correspondent has been work 
71, I ve actually been doing a lot of it 
72, oh wow 
73, nd uh I turned in my Master s thesis back in May and I m
74, actually presently working on um 
75, several uh articles 
76, oh okay 
77, Impressive xxx distortion 
78, from it 
79, yeah actually it turns out that one thing one little 
80, bit in what I was doing uh is going to turn out to be very
81, important in the end 
82, nd uh 
83, from what I had been reading in the literature 
84, You see the one very annoying thing about all of this was my
85, advisor has been in France for a year and a half 
86, yeah 
87, nd this made writing my thesis very annoying because you know
88, there wasn t much discussion 
89, yeah 
90, yup yup 
91, ut um 
92, nyway I had been 
93, kind of telling him that you know from my reading of the
94, literature I thought that this one little alteration I had made in
95, my model was kind of clever and unique 
96, mhm 
97, nd it f made 
98, w the one type of solution occur which 
99, was seen experimentally but none of the other models had uh had 
100, 
101, Yes 
102, They basically the I I m looking at um multi mode lasers 
103, nd one of the 
104, things that they find experimentally are what they call anti
105, phased uh states where 
106, if you look at the total intensity 
107, uhhuh 
108, of the laser you get 
109, an oscillation which is characterized by one frequency 
110, Yes 
111, okay 
112, If you look i if you separate out the different modes of the
113, laser 
114, mhm 
115, and look at one of those you get more than one frequency 
116, okay 
117, So what s happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase
118, so that they completely mask each other s 
119, Exactly 
120, hm 
121, oscillations on these other frequencies 
122, nd 
123, uh 
124, you can 
125, With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency 
126, in a transient but you can t find that frequency in a driven uh 
127, frequency 
128, You can t find so that it will sustain 
129, okay 
130, Yes 
131, So 
132, yeah that that particular frequency according to most models 
133, damps out very quickly 
134, nd so you shouldn t actually really be able to ever see it 
135, hm 
136, The only thing is that when you do the experiment you see it 
137, Got it got it 
138, I see 
139, So um I found a 
140, simple modification of the original formula which unfortunately
141, makes the solutions horrendously nasty 
142, nd in most cases uh insoluble 
143, ut 
144, yeah 
145, it gives a driving term laughs 
146, oh okay 
147, So it actually laughs 
148, creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer 
149, you just can t always write it down very easily 
150, Exactly 
151, oh wow 
152, So so so you you you re pushing forward the bounds of
153, theoretical laser 
154, laser uh whatever it is science 
155, ut which um is kind of interesting considering that that s not
156, really my thing 
157, laugh 
158, Indeed laughs 
159, Indeed 
160, e being an experimentalist not a theorist 
161, ut um 
162, Indeed 
163, oh wow 
164, oh impressive 
165, ut 
166, So so so are so are you going to get an article in Nature or
167, something 
168, um actually 
169, I m not sure if we re shooting for op I think 
170, Optics Letters is probably the one that we re shooting for or
171, else perhaps though 
172, I don t think it s quite that significant would be Phys Rev
173, Letters 
174, hm 
175, ut uh we want to write a letter and then a couple articles 
176, yeah 
177, hm 
178, xxx distorted impressive 
179, nd 
180, I I don t know how much you know about scientific literature but
181, letters are much more prestigious than articles 
182, oh okay 
183, oh w I I didn t realize that 
184, okay 
185, yeah so that that s why it s actually a big deal is 
186, I mean you know writing a couple of articles based on your
187, Master s thesis is 
188, not at all unusual in Physics inhales and 
189, yeah 
190, uh i it s the fact that I would be writing a letter that is the
191, impressive part of it all 
192, nd what s actually kind of interesting is I kept telling Neil that
193, I thought that this was kind of significant 
194, nd Neil kept writing back that I should tone this part of the
195, thesis down that 
196, laughs 
197, people have been seeing th 
198, You know people see the anti phased motion and it s true they do
199, in the transients nd 
200, I was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the
201, literature is in 
202, has this frequency in the transients 
203, Yes 
204, eh and not driven 
205, nd uh what happened was after I had turned in my thesis 
206, but before I saw Neil again he went to a conference in Rochester
207, and inhales there 
208, this was a big issue among the people who were doing this work 
209, was 
210, that their models couldn t show this as a driven frequency yet
211, their experiments showed it 
212, laughs 
213, as a driven frequency 
214, oh cool 
215, nd s and so Neil 
216, then 
217, Said oh just a second I 
218, like a week later came to ryn Mawr and he said hey Lowell we
219, got to write this up laughs 
220, Exactly laugh 
221, nd I was like well I ve been telling you that Neil laughs 
222, Indeed 
223, So 
224, Cool 
225, That s 
226, Cool 
227, that s mostly the sort of stuff that I m spending a lot of time on
228, now 
229, um 
230, Well it ll look good on your C V your resume 
231, So breath so you might as well spend the time 
232, Yes well inhales uh th no it s definitely worth doing 
233, um 
234, and I would have been spending more time on it if it weren t for uh
235, dealing with the burglary issues echo 
236, oh yeah but 
237, that I ve been dealing with 
238, So are you still living in that house in the middle of the park 
239, Yes 
240, lipsmack yeah okay 
241, yeah 
242, I mean the thing that i this place is incredibly easy to break
243, into if you want to 
244, oh 
245, It s not a question of whether or not uh 
246, you know that that was easy it was just that no one really knew
247, it was worth breaking into 
248, Exactly 
249, Exactly 
250, yeah 
251, nd so the problem is that now they found out that it s worth
252, breaking into 
253, yeah 
254, nd unfortunate ly 
255, Well i it s kind of odd 
256, They ve stolen very weird things for the most part 
257, hm 
258, as far yeah as a 
259, The first time they broke in they 
260, what they stole was just bizarre mostly worthless 
261, stuff 
262, nd uh 
263, huh 
264, the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they
265, stole was the preamplifier of my stereo 
266, Unfortunately because it s a nice preamplifier it has an off
267, board power supply which they didn t steal 
268, breath 
269, which makes the thing that they stoled absolutely worthless 
270, huh laughing breath 
271, So 
272, That s distortion bizarre 
273, izarre 
274, So so so when they broke in the second time did they steal the uh 
275, the uh off board amplifier 
276, ctually no all they stole the second time was my bike 
277, huh 
278, Which was actually where the major problem came 
279, Exactly 
280, Exactly 
281, yeah 
282, Is that I suddenly had no transportation 
283, nd so 
284, I then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike and
285, 
286, mm 
287, that that cost me a lot of time 
288, yeah 
289, Exactly 
290, ecause yes 
291, Spending a lot of time hunting for bikes and 
292, nah well 
293, then getting one purchased and then having to 
294, you know go get it and things like that 
295, ut 
296, that s dealt with at least 
297, nd so 
298, uh that s breath yeah 
299, at least dealt with 
300, Now I just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this 
301, ut 
302, yeah 
303, yeah 
304, t least 
305, Well that would make sense distortion 
306, during the summer I can actually 
307, uh 
308, according to the stipulations of my grant or my fellowship I can
309, actually earn money during the summer 
310, End
311,
