100, was ten weeks than 
101, yep yep yep 
102, you know after that 
103, when they re new infants it s like bring along a blanket so you can
104, nurse them 
105, nd like you could do anything 
106, You could probably go like do skydiving or something 
107, yeah 
108, I know 
109, nd if you were nursing the baby while you were skydiving the baby
110, would be like okay 
111, yeah 
112, lright 
113, s long as we re nursing while we re doing this that s okay 
114, That s what I thought too 
115, inhales nd they don t need that many clothes when they re that
116, young 
117, nd they don t need toys 
118, So 
119, You know basically you don t need to bring anything 
120, lipsmack ut uh but you know your two boobs laughs and uh

124, 
125, They re hard to forget 
126, laughs yeah 
127, Hard to leave behind 
128, yeah 
129, So I mean in then you know then we can just use disposables if

137, Disposables for travelling 
138, nd did you um 
139, bsolutely distortion 
140, Every now did you supplement nursing with bottles at all or didn t 
141, didn t you 
142, No 
143, No 
144, Somehow like I read too many of the xxx books so I thought it was
145, like no formula 
146, It does make a difference like I always thought formula smells kind
147, of disgusting inhales 
148, oh yeah 
149, Like when they throw up it smells disgusting and when they make
150, their little doodoos it smells grosser if they re on formula 
151, ut if they re totally breast milk now you ll find this hard this
152, believe but if they re totally breast milk for like the first couple
153, months 
154, mhm 
155, they don t their number twos don t smell at all 
156, oh okay 
157, They don t smell like anything 
158, It s like sniffing 
159, it looks like shit but it doesn t smell like anything laugh 
160, oh okay 
161, inhale nd did you pump or not 
162, yeah I pumped 
163, What joy that was 
164, Did you use a manual or a uh did you get one of those little
165, battery ones 
166, atter 
167, attery operated deal 
168, yeah 
169, I think so too 
170, Now like I can tell you I can find the exact brand name of it if
171, you want some time 
172, breath 
173, ut like it had like this little like nozzle attachment thing on it
174, which was what it said you were supposed to use 
175, mhm 
176, mhm 
177, nd I used it the first time for like three seconds I was like 
178, 
179, ah anguished get laughs this thing off me 
180, laughs 
181, That really hurt 
182, laughs 
183, inhales Don t ever do that again 
184, nd I forget what it said it was for I think it said it was for if
185, you had small breasts or something 
186, I don t know what 
187, oh okay 
188, so like I took that thing and I threw it away laughs 
189, laughs 
190, inhales It was like a little part you put on top of a nozzle
191, thing 
192, It was just like an extra attachment and I took that and I 
193, mhm okay distorted 
194, threw it away 
195, okay 
196, nd then it was fine 
197, okay 
198, So 
199, yeah 
200, That seemed to work fine inhales 
201, ye 
202, You know i if I if you could avoid it 
203, you know 
204, if y if it was a choice in your life to say inhales 
205, well for the first couple months I ll just be home and I ll just
206, get a lot of rest and I ll take it easy and if I m not 
207, sleeping at night I ll just sleep during the day or sleep when
208, the baby sleeps 
209, yeah 
210, Not do this whole pumping thing I mean if I had to do it all over
211, that s what I would do 
212, oh yeah because I was thinking it would be easier because then
213, other people could feed the baby and you wouldn t have to be so tied
214, to it 
215, xxx 
216, yeah 
217, nd if you want to go out to a movie or something 
218, Mean that you know did you 
219, Well we never go out laughing 
220, I mean you know what Norm and I are like I mean 
221, Well believe me when you have a baby you ll want you ll to put it
222, in someone else s house or someone come watch it in your house and
223, go anywhere else laughs 
224, See that s what I was thinking like for my in laws and stuff when
225, we go home for Christmas

227, It would be so nice to just you know leave the baby with them but
228, you can t leave the baby 
229, yeah 
230, I mean if you 
231, you know y you might have to try one or two before you find one
232, that works but 
233, yeah 
234, once and you know they have like things and like can set the
235, tension or whatever they get 
236, suck suck power 
237, laughs the tension laughs they re like the little knob on
238, your sewing machine laughing 
239, laughs 
240, laughs You can set the the power level and stuff and and it g 
241, 
242, inhales laughs inhales Or like extra suck for just starting

246, doing putting this machine on me it s disgusting 
247, laughs 
248, or obscene or something 
249, ut once you get used to it it was uh you know you can like read
250, while you re doing it 
251, It was like boring 
252, uhhuh 
253, okay 
254, nd what does it go into like a little plastic bag thingy 
255, uh well the thing I had was like 
256, like you screwed on this whole motor suction part 
257, uhhuh 
258, on to something that was just like a a jar bottom 
259, You know just looked like a screw thing so that it went to this
260, plastic container 
261, breath 
262, okay 
263, nd you can reuse the plastic container 
264, nd then what I would do is just uh I would bring little bags like
265, that you re supposed to put formula in with me to work 
266, oh okay 
267, nd then I d pour it from the container 
268, into the plastic bag and seal it up and then go you know rinse out
269, the container thing and wash it the next day 
270, nd did you throw away the plastic bags when you were done 
271, Well see then the plastic bag is designed to go inside a bottle
272, thing 
273, yeah 
274, nd th eh so then you so you throw the plastic bag away when
275, you re done 
276, fter your baby drinks the milk yeah
