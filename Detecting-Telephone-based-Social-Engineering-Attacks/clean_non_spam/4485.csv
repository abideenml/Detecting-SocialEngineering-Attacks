247, It s it s a it s gotten pretty good actually 
248, I ve learned some interesting stuff here this year 
249, re you doing simultaneous stuff 
250, breath No we re not doing any simultaneous 
251, Why not 
252, Not at all breath ecause um you ha I think you have you have
253, to for one thing you have to be a lot better at rabic than I am to
254, do it 
255, ut um mostly we re we spend most of our time on translation 
256, hm 
257, nd only a very little bit on interpreting 
258, nd the interpreting we do is is a consecutive liaison
259, interpreting 
260, What does that mean 
261, It means that um you you actually it it well you you do it by
262, paragraph 
263, mhm 
264, Small small sort of small bits of speech 
265, nd in some ways it s harder than simultaneous 
266, um because you have to not only remember what was said but you
267, have to get all the facts right you know 
268, You ha 
269, Right right 
270, You ve got to remember it all and 
271, yeah all the dates and amounts and you know 
272, So there s a there s a lot of practice in note taking and
273, devising your own sort of set of symbols that will jog your memory 
274, 
275, mhm 
276, you know because you can t you can t keep notes on a whole
277, paragraph of what somebody says 
278, Right 
279, You can t breath you just can t do it 
280, End
281,
