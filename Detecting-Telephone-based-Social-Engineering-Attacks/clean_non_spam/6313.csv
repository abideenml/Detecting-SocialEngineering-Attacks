0,Is is the program geared primarily toward um 
1, xxx 
2, um 
3, beginning level uh spanish speakers 
4, No breath 
5, No 
6, We offer seven different levels ranging from true beginners 
7, people who know absolutely nothing about spanish all the way up
8, through advanced and literature levels 
9, uhhuh 
10, So we have something for everybody 
11, When you breath 
12, arrive we would give you a placement test 
13, It s a two part test 
14, The first part is breath 
15, written 
16, and it would test you on present test um direct and indirect 
17, objects 
18, It goes all the way up to subjunctive and then you actually do
19, some writing as well breath 
20, ut after an ins instructor would grade that 
21, tsk 
22, then they would the se 
23, w 
24, would uh speak with you and that would be the second portion of
25, the test 
26, They would ask you a lot of questions about why you re here
27, studying spanish breath 
28, um where you re from tsk why are you interested in Spanish in
29, particular 
30, as opposed to some other language have you visited other places
31, within Mexico and whatnot 
32, They re really in 
33, zeroing in on breath how you 
34, use the language when you re speaking 
35, mm hm 
36, Tsk and that helps them to more fine tune breath where they
37, place you 
38, oh I see 
39, nd how many people are are in each group uh 
40, Maximum according to our brochure is ten 
41, lthough we have never had a group of ten 
42, um 
43, average is more around six I th and it can be lower 
44, uhhuh 
45, We ve had groups of one before laughs Is that a group 
46, I don t think that s a group breath laughs 
47, oh really 
48, xxx 
49, nd um 
50, How long is 
51, is the program 
52, breath It s designed to last four weeks 
53, but students can come by the week if they wish 
54, We advise breath 
55, if they do come by the week 
56, that they try to come at the beginning of the session so they don t
57, have instructional gaps breath 
58, You know when 
59, for example if the class is going on three weeks and then we
60, suddenly have a student arrive breath the end of the second or
61, third week 
62, it can be 
63, a little bit difficult and that student will 
64, enter into a class that s been in session already two or three
65, weeks breath 
66, um we frequently though do have students who don t arrive at the
67, beginning because their 
68, their schedules don t allow them to have 
69, you know conformity to our our schedule breath 
70, nd they they do it 
71, I have been a student here several times myself 
72, I m now the assistant director 
73, mm hm 
74, nd when I first came I came the last two weeks of the December
75, session and the first two weeks of the January session 
76, breath 
77, nd it was doable 
78, It was it was difficult the last two weeks 
79, Tsk but I did it breath It was the only time I had to operate
80, with and so it was alright 
81, breath 
82, nd then of course the January session when I started with the
83, rest of the group 
84, at the beginning of the session breath 
85, was 
86, more 
87, tsk 
88, easy to 
89, to 
90, to feel the flow of the class right away because the ground rules
91, were there 
92, in front of me 
93, uhhuh 
94, nd 
95, uh are the accommodations there on premises or 
96, No 
97, Tsk 
98, we we offer several options 
99, The the vast majority of our students take host family homes
100, breath 
101, as uh 
102, the way to go when they re here in Oaxaca breath They pay 
103, um a base price of eleven dollars a day 
104, nd that includes a private room 
105, and um 
106, full breakfast 
107, nd it may or may not include a private bath 
108, It really depends on each family 
109, We tell the students that 
110, it s not a hotel it s it s a it s a home breath thump 
111, mm hm 
112, nd the idea isn t so much for luxury it s more for 
113, um 
114, really communicating with people and to getting to know the culture
115, by way of the people 
116, breath 
117, nd the vast majority of the homes are upper middle class to lower
118, upper class 
119, They re very nice homes and they re families that we ve 
120, worked with for years breath 
121, um if a student wishes 
122, other meals 
123, with the host family 
124, for an additional four dollars a day the student can have
125, comida s spa which is the large midday meal 
126, mm hm 
127, nd you can eat very very well in Oaxaca on four dollars 
128, ut 
129, the the four dollar meal would be primarily for the purposes of of
130, 
131, interacting with the host family 
132, breath nd then there s the cena s spa which is the very light 
133, very late evening meal 
134, That s anywhere between seven thirty nine o clock at night 
135, mm hm 
136, breath 
137, That s an additional two dollars 
138, um it can be as simple as pan dulce s ita and a cup of hot
139, chocolate 
140, mm hm 
141, ut 
142, uh and it s not it s not formal it s not a formal meal the way
143, the the cena s spa is 
144, Would it be possible to accommodate vegetarians 
145, Or 
146, uhhuh 
147, oh yeah 
148, We do that all the time 
149, yeah we re very used to it 
150, oh 
151, xxx 
152, breath 
153, Especially here in Oaxaca well in Mexico in general with tortillas
154, and beans and all the the wealth of fruits and vegetables it would
155, be very simple 
156, breath 
157, uhhuh 
158, That s good 
159, If if students don t want to home stay and they wish 
160, to have um alternative accommodations we can help 
161, with apartments and hotels and that sort of thing 
162, breath 
163, um they would need to send a deposit 
164, ut um 
165, a lot of people when they call us they don t really speak enough
166, Spanish or they don t feel comfortable enough with their Spanish to
167, make reservations 
168, mhm 
169, re there hotels close by 
170, Or 
171, There s lots 
172, yeah
