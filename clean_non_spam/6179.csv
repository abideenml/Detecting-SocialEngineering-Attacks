9, I xxx I thought to myself when I was offered this opportunity to go
10, for a uh Shabbas meal at a religious family 
11, I said why not you know I said I m I m 
12, travelling to learn about myself and the world in which 
13, in which I live not to just sit on beaches and go to discotheques
14, in different countries 
15, yeah 
16, so why not 
17, you know let me learn a little bit 
18, I was a little frustrated and in the six weeks I had been
19, travelling I just met tourists 
20, you know I I didn t know Greek I didn t know Turkish so you know I
21, met tourists 
22, mm yes 
23, yeah 
24, and what s the point of it all anyway 
25, right 
26, you know going from one beach and ha having inhales you know 
27, basking in the sunshine what s the point of it all laugh 
28, that s right that s right 
29, there has to be a higher purpose 
30, that s right that s right 
31, you weren t born just to soak up sun 
32, that s right exactly so I I um I said here is an opportunity 
33, to see how a Jewish family lives why not 
34, and providence would have it that they were it was a June 
35, night there was that Friday night there was um over a hundred 
36, people who were going on a tour and who were set up for
37, shabbas s heb hospitality 
38, mm hm 
39, and this rabbi 
40, Rabbi oruch Rabin sent me to um 
41, a Rabbi Simcha Wasserman xxx may he be rest in peace 
42, He was uh a great rabbi whose father was one of the greatest
43, rabbis in Europe 
44, who um 
45, and he himself was a very knowledgeable rabbi 
46, and I was told that I I I um 
47, was was 
48, going to I was going with three other boys to a uh 
49, a rabbi s home a rabbi who you know who had lived in Europe and
50, lived in merica 
51, So I 
52, I don t remember exactly what I thought laughs thirteen years ago
53, but I can 
54, can conjure up somewhat of an image 
55, of laughs like a little bit of 
56, what I might have thought and I I ha I was little afraid that um
57, 
58, laughs 
59, laughs that you know um I m going to this rabbi s house and he s
60, going to chastize me he s going to say you Jewish boy what are doing
61, with your life you shouldn t you should do something with your life

63, is this

66, eh you sit in a university what is this you know why don t you do
67, something for a change 
68, yeah 
69, yes eh 
70, so when I got there it was I was 
71, pleasantly surprised to see nothing of the sort 
72, mm hm 
73, I was pleasantly surprised to see an older rabbi and his wife 
74, who bantered with each other playfully 
75, you know s clearly deeply in love 
76, hm 
77, mm hm 
78, um and 
79, I can t remember exactly what the rabbi said but I remember the
80, impression that I had 
81, that 
82, had as I said I was like 
83, a little on the defensive a little bit afraid of you know being 
84, dragged into some cult I didn t know anything about 
85, traditional Judaism inhales um 
86, and so had he approached me like 
87, eh offensively I think I would have 
88, you know been on the defensive I would ve retracted but because he
89, just 
90, was interested you know he was 
91, he just 
92, opened himself up he opened up his home it was beau it was
93, beautiful 
94, meal and the beautiful environment and he just opened up his 
95, mm hm 
96, his life to us 
97, yes 
98, um 
99, eh you know he and he 
100, I could tell he felt like a little bit 
101, exhale a almost he felt sorry for us 
102, yes 
103, and I I thought to myself you know eh I I 
104, eh I could express some of the thoughts that I might have felt at
105, that time that 
106, you know you feel sorry for me rabbi I m Phi eta Kappa Sigma Xi
107, honors going for a doctorate in 
108, laughs 
109, in one of the top universities in clinical psychology you know I m

111, laughs 
112, future ahead of me and you live in this small apartment in
113, Jerusalem you know and you re you re an older rabbi and you feel
114, sorry for me 
115, laughs 
116, so 
117, but he made me feel as if he s got a jewel 
118, not I don t think he was trying to do it 
119, you know in any um 
120, tsk subversive manner he wo he just made me feel that that that
121, he he wishes he could share something with me 
122, but it s unfortunate that he really can t because of my lack of
123, education 
124, so I was looking like I was trying to get a glimpse like what he s
125, what he s holding there what kind of 
126, pearl he s holding laughs there which really that pearl was was 
127, 
128, Judaism you know he he was he was holding a very meaningful 
129, life you know he he um

131, was a person f who was looking for teachers 
132, in my travels in life and I had met some you know um 
133, some friends and some older people in my travels that that I 
134, considered wise people who I could learn from 
135, yes

137, person he like he had 
138, windows which you know his eyes were like windows to his heart

140, spoke through it just 
141, End
