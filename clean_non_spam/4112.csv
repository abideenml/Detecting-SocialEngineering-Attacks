3, trying to figure out 
4, Well I told 
5, clears throat I told him too that I ll mention to him again 
6, on Monday but 
7, he doesn t h he s not well of coarse Mister Oharshi 
8, is not always 
9, prompt in his laughs answer either but 
10, but maybe Mister Furobiashi too will distortion 
11, Well I was just wondering maybe I should should I just pick a
12, date and and 
13, say I m coming 
14, yeah because I think you know at first we were talking about
15, that 
16, trying to work it in with the festival but I don t think it s going
17, to be good because of the fact 
18, Right 
19, that we 
20, f foreign teachers many of us want to go down to that xxx 
21, Sure 
22, which is right after you know which we ll leave like on the Friday
23, night 
24, uh the third and then be down for the fourth and fifth 
25, mhm

27, general scheduling laughs you know like you ve done before and
28, not bother hit it on that weekend distortion 
29, We 
30, yeah 
31, okay 
32, Well I m um what I was trying to figure 
33, clears throat 
34, I asked some of the students here whether they thought it was
35, better to arri to be there before or after the fall festival and
36, they said after 
37, uhhuh 
38, Do you agree 
39, Yes 
40, Well mainly because there are 
41, especially if it s just the few days before that s when the
42, students finally get down to preparing for the festival inhales
43, and so those days are really pretty 
44, yeah 
45, pretty busy 
46, nd so after the festival it s uh they re freer a lot freer so
47, if you could make it after that weekend 
48, What about just I m looking at the calendar trying to figure 
49, what about say on November 
50, say if I were there November n 
51, either come in on the ninth or you know the evening of the eighth
