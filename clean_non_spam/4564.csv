13, at the word processor and then breath late at night I send it
14, over you know the online ov on email

26, the next day not possibly in a week 
27, You know that you know that what you re saying is going to be
28, heard 
29, Sometimes when you write a letter you figure eventually they re
30, going to get this and it s already going to be old news and you know
31, this it s more of a communica you feel like you re really
32, communicating with email
