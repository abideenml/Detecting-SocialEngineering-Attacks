218, Tops 
219, nd I got a card from you remember my Gleason 
220, yeah 
221, yeah 
222, Well she just had a baby a couple of 
223, xxx 
224, heard that 
225, Well this is this is number two 
226, okay 
227, I just got a card from Ron and Doris 
228, oh 
229, and they see my Gleason on occasion 
230, nd so I think they told me that 
231, yeah 
232, Have you heard from Ron and Doris 
233, Not in a while no 
234, They are now living in Rhode Island 
235, you probably knew that 
236, Well 
237, yeah 
238, nd she s teaching at U R I 
239, yeah 
240, nd it was a very nice letter because it sounded like she went
241, through very similar things that I did 
242, you know I went from Chicago to U C S G to here 
243, Right 
244, nd it s just such an intellectual leftd letdown 
245, Right 
246, nd she went from Penn to um 
247, To Columbia 
248, to Columbia to U R I 
249, Well Columbia s okay 
250, yeah 
251, nd she said the students are just you know they don t care and
252, they re not very good and all of a sudden she s getting conference
253, papers rejected and she thinks it s the affiliation 
254, yeah 
255, ecause she doesn t think the quality of her work has changed 
256, Now I haven t submitted a conference paper with the Missouri 
257, um you know w affiliation yet 
258, ecause the last one I submitted um was in the fall and I still
259, had my San Diego affiliation 
260, yeah 
261, um in fact I m still officially on leave 
262, laughs breath 
263, If anything came up in the next year we could still go back 
264, uhhuh 
265, uh you know for Sam 
266, Wow 
267, but I think it s e very very very very 
268, yeah 
269, laughs breath 
270, unlikely 
271, yeah 
272, laughs breath 
273, but at any rate it was nice to hear from her because she said after
274, two years there now she um has come to terms with this and 
275, yeah 
276, she s accepted that there s a lot of good things in Rhode Island 
277, nd um you know e their life is a lot less complicated and she
278, has more time to be a parent 
279, yeah 
280, Good 
281, nd she s just not going to have the same kind of career that she
282, had thought about Ron is working as a financial consultant for um 
283, Meryl Lynch 
284, nd he 
285, oh 
286, yeah he had been doing work for some environmental firm as a
287, consultant 
288, uhhuh 
289, nd it didn t work out 
290, He um 
291, He was changing projects every couple of weeks and he said he
292, couldn t keep on top of it 
293, He couldn t learn the whole new area 
294, mm 
295, that fast each time 
296, mm 
297, um and he says he went in and had some tests and he was diagnosed
298, as having attention deficit disorder 
299, Which 
300, you know given how he s how far he s gotten you know he got his
301, degree at Tufts and all I found that surprising that for the first
302, time as an adult they re diagnosing this 
303, um 
304, mm 
305, I wonder about it 
306, but anyway 
307, yeah but that s what he said 
308, nd um 
309, yeah 
310, He um 
311, Whatever s helpful 
312, Right 
313, So he found this new job as a financial consultant and seems to be
314, happy with that 
315, Good 
316, nd then we saw Leo and Julie at Christmas time 
317, uhhuh 
318, nd they re doing great 
319, um they had just moved to

323, Good 
324, an older home that you know Julie is of course carving up and
325, making beautiful 
326, um 
327, uhhuh 
328, Now she had a job with an architectural group when she first got
329, out to New York and that didn t work out 
330, She said they had her doing things that she really wasn t qualified
331, to do 
332, ah 
333, and that she d really didn t feel competent doing 
334, nd they mutually agreed that she should leave 
335, laughs 
336, nd so she was looking for another job 
337, nd um I m sure she ll find one 
338, She s so talented 
339, She may have found one by now 
340, um
