1, When did you first see her 
2, um what happened is we went to the hospital she was induced 
3, mhm 
4, So we get a phone call and th she was supposed to 
5, Right finally 
6, um the birth mom was supposed to go in at um it s my thinking that
7, this will be distributed publicly 
8, Right 
9, at um six thirty in the morning but she called and they didn t
10, have any beds 
11, oh no 
12, So she called us and told us that but then they did get a bed and
13, she went in at eight 
14, mhm 
15, Or seven thirty or I guess she went in at seven thirty and they
16, started her at eight or so so we hopped in the car and drove down to
17, be there 
18, mhm 
19, mm mhm 
20, for the day 
21, mhm 
22, nd um 
23, we hung out all day 
24, We had uh we had some difficult times with the lawyer down there 
25, He was supposed to show up 
26, mm 
27, mhm 
28, and we waited all day and he never bloody showed up 
29, oh no 
30, nd um he and also she was expecting him too 
31, mhm 
32, You know and so that was frustrating 
33, yeah 
34, ut anyway we waited all day and um 
35, ut then five twenty five Mae was born 
36, Right 
37, nd the birth mother s mother was with her through the whole thing
38, and she was fantastic 
39, She was just great 
40, She was so nice to us and so solid there for her daughter and just
41, a wonderful 
42, uhhuh 
43, mhm 
44, Woman xxx 
45, person and um 
46, She was great 
47, She came out you know a couple times during the day she came out
48, and gave us little progress reports of how things were going and
49, actually it was very funny 
50, uhhuh 
51, because the first time she out laugh I mean here we re out there
52, sort of ringing our hands and 
53, uhhuh 
54, sweating it out and wondering how everybody is going and everything
55, and she came out and could I go downstairs because um her daughter
56, wanted playing cards 
57, uhhuh 
58, So I guess she was bored 
59, uhhuh 
60, You know passing the time laughs 
61, laughs 
62, So I went downstairs to get playing cards with her and 
63, uhhuh 
64, and then later on she came out and she wanted some chewing gum 
65, laughs 
66, uhhuh laugh 
67, um I guess your mouth gets dry and you just want something 
68, yeah 
69, I m sure 
70, So you know it was it was kind of funny these very 
71, Reassuring in a way I would think 
72, y yeah but these very um 
73, yeah 
74, you know they re such sort of specific little things laugh 
75, yeah 
76, nd um 
77, then but they kind of held her back 
78, I think the baby would ve born been born sooner but the doctor
79, didn t get there till around three 
80, So 
81, so I thought once it was induced there was like no stopping it 
82, No they can hold you back 
83, hm 
84, a little bit you know 
85, hm 
86, Once depends how much stuff they give you 
87, How much stuff they give you 
88, yeah 
89, Stuff 
90, ut anyway I think they were holding her back a little bit because
91, they wanted the doctor there 
92, mhm 
93, uhhuh 
94, um and the doctor showed up around three and Mae was born at five
95, twenty five 
96, mhm 
97, Eight pounds eight ounces 
98, mhm 
99, nd screaming 
100, mhm 
101, Really screaming and I was a little scared 
102, I thought oh my god what have we wrought 
103, You could here her out through the doors of the hall you know 
104, laughs 
105, uhhuh 
106, nd there were a lot of babies being born 
107, You didn t hear them all 
108, uhhuh 
109, nd I and um what happened h I guess um breath that s right 
110, Her mom came running out to tell us the baby was born 
111, uhhuh 
112, nd then she said that s her 
113, You can hear her laughs 
114, laughs 
115, nd um lipsmack said it was a beautiful birth 
116, I mean two pushes and she was out which is really great so she s
117, very unsquashed and unbattered looking for a new baby 
118, uhhuh mhm 
119, Right 
120, Usually they look a bit bashed up breath 
121, yeah 
122, bit worn 
123, ut she s got a nice shaped head and you know she doesn t look
124, like she was um you know she s not a cone head 
125, mhm 
126, ut did you get to see her in a few hours or 
127, a 
128, Well what happened no right away there there was a very nice um 
129, 
130, delivery nurse who we had spoken to earlier in the day named Tina 
131, 
132, mhm 
133, mhm 
134, mhm 
135, nd what they do is they take the baby from the delivery room to
136, the nursery 
137, mhm 
138, Normally they go directly and Tina very very sweetly zipped past
139, the door to the out outer part of the nursery where we were waiting
140, 
141, mhm 
142, mhm outside 
143, mhm 
144, and let us hold her 
145, mhm 
146, So she was just minutes old then 
147, Wow 
148, So we held her for just a couple minutes and 
149, uhhuh 
150, it was really funny because you could hear her coming up the hall
151, screaming 
152, uhhuh 
153, loudly 
154, uhhuh 
155, uhhuh 
156, She handed her to me screaming loudly and I said to Tina and also
157, to the 
158, uhhuh 
159, the birth mother s mother there you know oh Robert has the magic
160, touch 
161, I handed her to Robert 
162, Instant silence 
163, uhhuh 
164, uhhuh 
165, Instant 
166, She just stopped screaming immediately 
167, uhhuh 
168, uhhuh 
169, So he held her for a little while 
170, nd then the nurse was afraid to take her back 
171, Said oh she s going to scream again laughs 
172, uh 
173, uhhuh laughs 
174, nd she did laughs 
175, uhhuh 
176, nd off they went to the nursery and then you watched through the
177, glass 
178, That must have distorted been very reassuring for Robert 
179, It was very nice wasn t it 
180, It was very wonderful for Robert and for me too just to see I knew
181, it would work too 
182, Very nice 
183, yeah 
184, uhhuh 
185, uhhuh 
186, yeah 
187, I don t know what it is 
188, He has some you have a theory 
189, ody warmth or something but anyway 
190, yeah 
191, I think it s partly it but there re certain kind of men who I
192, think it s men who have like these big 
193, I have this theory laughing that it s men who are very broad
194, right under the elbow you know like 
195, Wait a minute 
196, road under the elbow 
197, You mean in the chest 
198, like 
199, No 
200, From the elbow down towards the wrist 
201, oh 
202, Who have like these big broad forearms 
203, laughs 
204, laughs 
205, I think babies like that 
206, You think it gives it gives security 
207, I suppose 
208, xxx Do you remember Otto who moved my filing cabinet that time in
209, Philadelphia he s another one 
210, Yes 
211, uhhuh 
212, uhhuh 
213, yeah 
214, He s big 
215, He s sort of solid to me 
216, who 
217, He s sort of very solid and they xxx just love it distortion 
218, ut Robert s not big like that 
219, No but he but Robert is big below the elbows I ll bet if you
220, check 
221, laughs I ll have to check out below Robert s elbows laughs 
222, laughs 
223, t any rate um 
224, So that was nice and then we watched through the nursery while they
225, do 
226, if you survive the first four hours of life in the nursery you ll
227, survive anything after 
228, It s the most sort of appalling introduction to life 
229, uhhuh 
230, uhhuh 
231, uhhuh 
232, uhhuh 
233, ut I was kind of scared at that point because we re looking in and
234, there re all these nice sweet little pale babies lying there limp 
235, 
236, uhhuh 
237, and there s Mae and she s big compared to the rest and she was
238, bright red and she is screaming and she screamed and she screamed
239, and she screamed and all the rest of them as soon as they 
240, uhhuh 
241, uhhuh 
242, uhhuh 
243, uhhuh distortion 
244, uhhuh 
245, they sort of get exhausted after two screams and collapse 
246, yeah 
247, nd she was healthy I guess 
248, uhhuh laugh 
249, nd she just screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed and
250, screamed and I thought oh my god what have we wrought here laughs
251, 
252, Did they tell you her apgar or whatever they call that 
253, How xxx 
254, They didn t tell us anything 
255, In fact at the hospital they weren t 
256, the there were someth the individual people we had contact with
257, were were decent to us and friendly 
258, Were nice 
259, but um the hospital policy was rather unfriendly to us and they
260, wouldn t like we had been told we they have a room called the
261, bonding room 
262, yeah 
263, uhhuh 
264, uhhuh 
265, and the whole purpose of the room is to let people be in it with
266, the baby who 
267, uhhuh 
268, are going to be with the baby 
269, Right 
270, nd they wouldn t let us in there so 
271, mm 
272, d it was really quite awful 
273, They wouldn t let us they didn t they they gave us but they
274, didn t tell us beans 
275, yeah 
276, I mean they really didn t talk to us 
277, They didn t offer us that parenting class that they offer to most
278, people 
279, mhm 
280, We would have had to come back the next day to the hospital which
281, of course we weren t going to do 
282, hm 
283, mhm 
284, um you know they really weren t very nice and 
285, yeah 
286, I guess they have their rules are just very rigid 
287, mm 
288, nd the problem is the lawyer was supposed to have arranged for um
289, 
290, Right 
291, an additional bracelet 
292, mhm 
293, In other words what happens is they put one on the wrist of the
294, baby one on the ankle one on the birth mother 
295, and then she has a what you call the fourth bracelet which she can
296, give to whoever will be her coach through the birth and stuff and of
297, course she had given it to her mother 
298, hm 
299, mhm 
300, hm 
301, I see 
302, I see 
303, which makes perfect sense 
304, mhm 
305, Well the only way they couldn t get their minds around the notion
306, of a fifth bracelet for us 
307, Right 
308, So the only way that they would have let us in there was to take
309, her mothers away 
310, Right 
311, which we wouldn t ask and which she wouldn t do 
312, Right 
313, Right 
314, nd um 
315, the lawyer had told us he had arranged everything ahead of time 
316, and there was supposed to be I D there at the hospital for us and
317, it was all set and of course he hadn t done anything 
318, I see 
319, He hadn t done that hm 
320, No 
321, He hadn t done anything 
322, He s been just hopeless 
323, hm 
324, I mean I think legally he s not hopeless 
325, I think he s done all the necessary legal things but um 
326, yeah 
327, you know in terms of the things 
328, He s an S O forgive me tape whoever you are but he was a fucker
329, laugh 
330, yeah 
331, No 
332, th laughs 
333, nd um laughs 
334, xxx laugh 
335, I m sorry but he was 
336, I think they said published actually laughs 
337, oh well they can edit that word I guess laughs nyway it s
338, English so laughs 
339, yeah 
340, It s merican English 
341, laughs 
342, um 
343, You know he he said things to me like well you ll have her for the
344, rest of your life you know 
345, yeah 
346, Don t worry about it which is really an arrogant attitude to take 
347, you know 
348, yeah 
349, yeah 
350, Man laughs 
351, yeah 
352, He was really he was a real arrogant S O so 
353, How old was he 
354, I don t know we never met him 
355, He never showed up 
356, oh 
357, W he ended up in the end his par he sent his partner to
358, actually sign the papers who s not even an adoption attorney 
359, mhm 
360, He does litigation 
361, Doesn t know what he s doing but I hope he did what his partner
362, told him to do 
363, mhm 
364, mm distorted 
365, mhm 
366, ut he at least was a sensitive human being 
367, mhm 
368, nd um you know so that was nice 
369, He had some sensitivity 
370, We re going to get cut off soon 
371, oh no distorted 
372, nd I want to I hope you 
373, Tell me something then 
374, I ll shut up 
375, You can tell me something 
376, What 
377, okay 
378, No 
379, I m worrying ab I m not worrying I m feeling like oh my gosh
380, should all of this be in the public record or something 
381, oh yes 
382, Well they just beeped 
383, I think that might mean we have to hang up 
384, okay

403, They were loose or in a 
404, Well I they were loose they were I said the Sheila I think I hear a
405, parakeet

431, nd also in parts of Spain I don t know if they have this in parts
432, of France but 
433, Probably not laughs 
434, I saw parts of Spain where they had birds on the shutters and they
435, put them out during the day 
436, It s very popular in Spain but it s not so popular here in France 
437, 
438, yeah 
439, It was a nice thing 
440, yeah 
441, um 
442, I ve seen very little of it
