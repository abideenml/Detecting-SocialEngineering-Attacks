12, sounds like 
13, he s already committed to he said that he s going to move in there
14, so 
15, y 
16, I don t want to tell him something now and have him 
17, says something different to the people he s gi giving a commitment
18, to now 
19, Well I mean he s under no obligation if you tell him like well
20, actually this girl bagged 
21, laughs you know 
22, Well it was more I thought that just whether you were comfortable
23, with him 
24, than it was wi whether whether or not we had somebody to move in
25, but 
26, yeah I mean that was the original issue 
27, right 
28, ut I m I guess what I m trying to say is that I 
29, You d be willing to give it a chance 
30, breath at this point breath I feel like breath I don t have

39, Well I mean I hope you weren t you know you know your mind wasn t
40, like made up for you you know 
41, It was in a little bit to a certain extent yeah 
42, because 
43, you know and it s nobody s fault really it s just bad really 
44, abysmal timing 
45, you know 
46, Well yeah 
47, and 
48, I 
49, whatever laughs I mean 
50, I guess you could say shit happens 
51, yeah okay

54, but I mean 
55, it s really frustrating here because I have no control over it too
56, you know laughs 
57, so it s like 
58, yeah well it makes it equally 
59, and then t 
60, hard to have any decisions done 
61, to think that whatever that it had been all wrapped up and
62, everything was solved and then to have 
63, you know to get this email from Sarah like oh I m so happy I m
64, moving back in there 
65, right she she clearly didn t see that it was important 
66, like you know you had a commitment 
67, show you the place

90, you know we re splitting it Ming 
91, yeah

93, like myself distorted 
94, bad feelings about the whole thing I feel like I screwed you guys
95, over by moving in with you 
96, basically 
97, Well I think 
98, because I mean you know these fellowships I m applying for almost
99, all of them require that I live abroad 
100, you had it pretty much 
101, you know 
102, yeah

107, but I mean that s something that you and I have to talk about too 
108, 
109, yeah 
110, on just 
111, not even on the housing level but on the 
112, yeah obviously on the whole different situation

144, You can t get on to any computers or 
145, Well I can use Sarah s but I mean obviously she needs to use it too
146, and
