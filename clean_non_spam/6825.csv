0,um Typus this is the one that 
1, Tsk oh wait I also have one quest 
2, There are 
3, there are two 
4, there are two problems that I ve sort of been working on in 
5, you know in e w 
6, off and on breath 
7, um one is 
8, you have three schools 
9, exactly n people at each school 
10, each person at each school knows at least n l plus one of two n l
11, people at the other schools 
12, Prove that there at least three people who all know each other
13, knowing knowing is mutual 
14, That 
15, yeah 
16, oh you know who you should talk to about that one 
17, Dave 
18, No 
19, Who 
20, Let s see 
21, Who do we know that s into statistics 
22, Steve 
23, That s not statistics 
24, It s a combinatorical combinatorial problem 
25, That s statistics 
26, There s a there is 
27, No 
28, Yes um set set sets of n l probability 
29, breath 
30, is probability and statistics 
31, Probabil 
32, No no no 
33, It s not probability it 
34, No I know 
35, ut 
36, prove that that it must 
37, It involves stati i 
38, Right 
39, ut I I mean I ve gotten I ve 
40, like 
41, e there laughs I tried I tried the simplest way to solve it and
42, that 
43, that isn t 
44, that isn t enough 
45, breath nd then I m working on the second one which says
46, something like breath 
47, okay 
48, at the first school you have n l people who know n l plus one 
49, people 
50, breath out of two n l people 
51, That means that they know n l squared plus n l laughs um of two
52, n l people 
53, they re right yeah 
54, I I I it s not going to make any sense until I sit down with a
55, pencil and paper and s 
56, Like 
57, okay 
58, okay well 
59, That s the only way I understand maths is like 
60, okay 
61, I don t 
62, Sorry 
63, until I ve worked on it 
64, I like 
65, No it depends on how complicated i 
66, okay well I ll I ll send you e if you want I ll send you these two
67, questions that I m working on 
68, yeah 
69, That would be good because 
70, ecause 
71, because it s like 
72, e 
73, e they re they re w 
74, they re not difficult problems breath 
75, nd 
76, and I understand exactly what s happening in them 
77, um or I mean I understand plenty of what s happening 
78, I msure there s there s a lot more that I don t understand or else
79, the solution would probably be really simple breath 
80, um 
81, xxx 
82, breath but i it s it s really fun but really laughs 
83, but e I wish it it were were going more quickly breath 
84, um 
85, ut I I m just 
86, I m really really happy this person 
87, you know posted this list of things 
88, nd the the really the really cool thing about it is breath 
89, yeah 
90, um 
91, like 
92, there are a lot of problems that 
93, like there are some problems that that because of the geometry
94, center 
95, I was able to to 
96, like give answers to immediately 
97, breath 
98, nd then there are others 
99, What happens if you cut a Moebius strip in half 
100, yeah 
101, Now what does happen 
102, E I m no I m not sure on that one 
103, I haven t 
104, D do you did did you did you save that list someplace 
105, I have the 
106, um U R L 
107, breath okay 
108, xxx 
109, ecause because e what I could do with the problems that I m
110, working on is just 
111, give you the numbers if you 
112, yeah let s see 
113, I m trying to 
114, wanted to look at them 
115, That would I mean that would be easier 
116, Now 
117, ut 
118, xxx 
119, I I actually I have stuff saved in a text xxx 
120, Would it be too simplistic to say you just get two Moebius strips 
121, 
122, xxx huh 
123, I said if we re cutting the Moebius strip in 
124, in half 
125, wouldn t you just get two Moebius strips 
126, No that s not what happens 
127, W why not 
128, Cut a Moebius strip in half and you ll see 
129, ut w 
130, cut cut in half which way 
131, Lengthwise 
132, okay yeah 
133, That I didn t 
134, Draw draw a line in the midde 
135, oh wait never mind 
136, yeah 
137, That wouldn t work 
138, The the 
139, draw a line in the middle of the Moebius strip and cut 
140, along that line 
141, W okay I 
142, Yes 
143, That s right 
144, I see what part of the problem would be then 
145, breath nd and the thing that probably was the most humbling
146, thing 
147, breath 
148, is you know the 
149, the description of 
150, of the xxx circle in oston 
151, yeah I saw that 
152, um 
153, Eye to the eye 
154, yeah breath 
155, breath 
156, Wait 
157, ah breath 
158, breath and 
159, I don t know I I I ve never dealt with imaginary xxx so I m not
160, sure 
161, yeah I mean well it has to do with complex numbers 
162, nd Igot 
163, When hen I get back I I 
164, I 
165, can try to explain it 
166, it to you because 
167, someone did explain it to me 
168, nd i 
169, i 
170, breath I I don t completely understand it but I think 
171, Now I want to figure it out 
172, fter going through xxx 
173, I I 
174, know enough about complex numbers that 
175, I theoretically should have a clue if I like 
176, okay well I certainly I I breath 
177, maybe then then you can when I get back explain everything you know
178, about complex numbers because 
179, It s been a long time 
180, um xxx 
181, Well breath 
182, between now and then you can figure it all out again 
183, Cool I m really hoping whoever it was that hit my page in the
184, geometry center liked it 
185, Like 
186, they were looking at it three times so 
187, Three times 
188, Yes 
189, How do you know it was the same person 
190, It was 
191, It was like three times like in a row so it was like you know
192, flipping back between pages 
193, That s really weird 
194, breath 
195, Well I mean this is this is when they re making decisions 
196, So breath it s entirely possible that you ll get a job at the
197, geometry center and then I probably won t breath 
198, ut 
199, you know 
200, that would be 
201, End
202,
