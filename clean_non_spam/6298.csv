23, yeah 
24, yeah

40, breath 
41, when they re there

49, breath 
50, No I I think breath 
51, You know I mean 
52, Th maybe maybe we could do something different 
53, Maybe we could actually partition somehow

56, it on shelves breath 
57, they re still going to be able to get at it John you know
