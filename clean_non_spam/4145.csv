155, He s really an active baby 
156, Thumper 
157, Well that s good 
158, yeah

170, night he is he does kick and so you can feel him kicking in the
171, middle of the night if you wake up 
172, What if it s a girl 
173, lipsmack breath 
174, com something drops 
175, Well it s probably not a girl because in our family it s o if
176, you go on both sides of our family and you look at all our first
177, cousins and everything it s like seventy five percent male 
178, huh 
179, ut it might be a girl 
180, I was positive it was a girl 
181, Like the first three months I was absolutely positive it was a
182, girl 
183, nd then I changed my mind an 
184, laughs 
185, laughs now she distortion is a boy 
186, Well that ll be a surprise then 
187, yeah yeah 
188, I don t know 
189, xxx distortion 
190, re you going to ask them not to tell you if you had 
191, oh we re not having an ultrasound 
192, uhhuh 
193, ecause it s really like 
194, We went and looked up all this research 
195, There s all this stuff 
196, You ll see when you get pregnant 
197, nd 
198, laughs 
199, If if you want to know just send me email 
200, ecause I looked up a bunch of stuff but there s all this
201, research like on there s all different kinds of prenatal tests that
202, you can get now 
203, It s not just amnio it s like inhales other stuff too 
204, uhhuh 
205, nd then there s also um 
206, you know the the uh the ultrasound 
207, ut exhale in fact like 
208, if you look at the l the la the latest research on ultrasound 
209, it s like they really don t know 
210, inhales Like they assume that it s safe because you know 
211, they ve had it for twenty years right 
212, nd nothing has happened 
213, They never 
214, Ye well they don t know 
215, They ve never really done any big studies on it or anything 
216, ut the but if you re a normal low like there s reasons to have
217, an ultrasound 
218, nd if you have to have an ultrasound then it s a really good
219, diagnostic tool right 
220, Right 
221, ut in a normal low risk pregnancy like mine it s not a good
222, diagnostic tool at all 
223, Like 
224, is they find as many um false positives as they do false
225, negatives 
226, For for spina bifida and stuff 
227, Well the only thing they can really check they can check the
228, heart 
229, uhhuh 
230, inhales nd then they can check to see if the baby has a brain 
231, inhales nd then they can do like 
232, yeah 
233, ut then they can do some measurements to see if the baby has um 
234, 
235, ah 
236, Defects of various kinds 
237, Like Down s Syndrome 
238, Like sometimes y ut that s not really very good 
239, Like amnio is the only sure way to find out 
240, Right 
241, ut it could give you like some indications that the baby might
242, have Down s or something 
243, ut it s really not a very good diagnostic tool at all for people
244, with low risk pregnancies 
245, So 
246, yeah 
247, inhales I didn t bother getting one 
248, yeah good 
249, I m sure everything will be fine laugh 
250, oh yeah 
251, nd if it s not it s like you know you re going to have to deal
252, with it anyway 
253, Well what are you going to do I mean if it s not like inhale
254, and we didn t do any of the testing because like 
255, I I ve met like three people since I got pregnant where the baby
256, had Down s right 
257, They found out the baby had Down s 
258, nd they aborted it 
259, They had well it s not called abortion it s called termina 
260, Termination that s right 
261, nd I jus I just couldn t have done that 
262, I just 
263, We talked about it a little bit you know what I mean 
264, Like 
265, obviously I don t want my baby to have a mental defect or anything
266, like that 
267, ut 
268, ut if it does you ll deal with it 
269, I just could not have done that 
270, So it wasn t worth doing the prenatal testing 
271, ecause you know 
272, If you re not going to abort anyway then there s no reason to have
273, it 
274, yeah 
275, I mean there are like some there are some conditions that they can
276, test for that are sort of incompatible with life 
277, Right 
278, ut then I figured well I ll just go through the nine months of
279, pregnancy and then the baby will die when it s born 
280, You know 
281, If it s like that 
282, yeah 
283, yeah we had this friend 
284, This is not supposed to scare you it s just because it was on the
285, topic 
286, ut um but the baby died at like eight and a half months 
287, mm 
288, I know 
289, I read so many of those stories 
290, They just freak me out 
291, You know 
292, nd of course they make you have give birth anyway 
293, You know you can t have an 
294, You have to 
295, I mean what are xxx distortion 
296, I mean that s how you have an abortion is you give birth you kn 
297, distortion 
298, yeah 
299, nd it s dead you know it s dead 
300, nd it s a hassle you know 
301, nd you ve got to go through all that pain knowing the baby s not
302, even alive anyway 
303, yeah distortion 
304, ut you know 
305, She s a pregnant again 
306, You know sh they re fine 
307, nd what happened to the baby 
308, Do they know 
309, They got over it 
310, I think it got either strangled by its cord or some kind of 
311, yeah that s what they g They always say that g 
312, They say that but 
313, cord accident 
314, It s an it was an accident 
315, It s like they don t know distorted 
316, yeah you know 
317, It s like something happened 
318, Or or maybe it 
319, it went into 
320, oxygen deficiency or something 
321, Like something happened to her and she was asleep at the time 
322, yeah 
323, mhm 
324, and so she didn t even know it until the next morning 
325, nd 
326, It was something like that 
327, Wow 
328, That is so scary 
329, ut obviously you know y when you have a baby 
330, for the rest of its life and your life you have to worry that it
331, might die you know or something will happen to it 
332, oh I know it is so scary distorted
