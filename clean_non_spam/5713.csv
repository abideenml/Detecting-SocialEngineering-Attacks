5, because they they were sort of checking things out here a little
6, bit about emu apparently there s no 
7, um 
8, commercial emu raising in the country this is one of the problems
9, is this they can t uh th the problem is slaughtering them 
10, No that s state was weird because I can t imagine it whatever place
11, slaughters 
12, ecause that s the prob that s the p that s the problem here too
13, in the United States is the slaughtering of them 
14, ostriches I wa 
15, yeah 
16, eh the xxx U S Dems Department of griculture Leary is setting up
17, a lye affecting industry they re interviewing pressure by government
18, agencies 
19, hm 
20, I mean there are places but it seems it not so much it s hard to do
21, 
22, ut uh just like they needed to be classified as livestock first
23, they re going for human consumption 
24, No but why wouldn t they be able to slaughter to get it with the
25, ostriches if ostriches are being slaughtered 
26, I would think they would well I can no I got all kinds of stuff I
27, could mail her do so does she speak English too or 
28, yeah you can mail English stuff I mean that s

33, okay 
34, yeah 
35, and um wha tell me whatever was the end with the electricity in
36, your house 
37, Pardon 
38, What was the problem with the elec 
39, oh it was a freak thing basically it vibrated uh 
40, uh oh uh it was called a dead short 
41, oh wire came loose on a main ground line inside and the whole
42, system just shut down which is normal 
43, Where was the wire 
44, took them 
45, up in the attic crawl space very hard to get to 
46, Do you mean like maybe just even reverberations from the fan or
47, something 
48, Probably that what he thinks he just you know he just happened to
49, happen to write down unrelated to current surge said it s a very
50, unusual thing to happen 
51, mhm 
52, nyhow as it was there there was no fire hazard from it because
53, they grounded it right out but you know no one 
54, took him fore you know he did not find it then and then we came
55, back took almost four hours to locate finally where it was 
56, Wow wow 
57, ut anyway you replace that and a couple other circuits on it 
58, uhhuh 
59, and change a few things on the wiring too but as I said it was just
60, a weird thing where it actually 
61, disconnected very poorly put on it wasn t really fastened the
62, proper way 
63, yeah how much did you have to pay for it 
64, xxx 
65, hundred and twenty which is very reasonable 
66, mhm yeah 
67, you spend I mean that s counting parts too that s way way below the
68, normal rate 
69, right yeah distortion 
70, then he s going to help me do a few things on the bottom the snow
71, is like so steady and I could hardly see 
72, oh yeah it sounds nice

317, Having a olive s olive picking olive s some sort kind of an olive
318, festival in a a bunch of rab villages there 
319, and a couple of small Jewish villages 
320, Where I guess it s the end of the olive picking time and there s
321, supposed to be tours of these 
322, places where they make the olive oil and it sounds like it could be
323, pretty interesting and maybe some folklore type music and stuff also
324, 
325, yeah that ll be nice I 
326, and we had ordered a car a while back we thought we were going to
327, visit Dave and Zvir this weekend

333, I think I ve tried to get down there and each time sort of Dorothy
334, kind of well you know and you know 
335, I guess she s hesitant about people coming to visit 
336, mhm 
337, Though Miriam did se was there saw them for a couple hours she was
338, in Jerusalem 
339, and she said you can see it s not always the same because 
340, sometim xxx she was talking to him 
341, and he was going over a map and pointing things out to her 
342, Which to her seemed like they were totally off 
343, and a little while later he was talking and all the instructions
344, were fine 
345, mhm 
346, He just speech is a little bit slurred but you can sti you know
347, you can understand him 
348, Which is better feeling it s probably how it s going to stay the
349, you know I don t xxx way I m just yo it s getting better but 
350, yeah 
351, I m sure he s never going to drive again or anything like that even
352, though they won t admit it yet
