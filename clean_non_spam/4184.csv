19, 
20, oh okay 
21, sh 
22, oh that s funny 
23, inhales oh okay and lipsmack 
24, hm 
25, um there are other things I need to tell you 
26, I was talking to Spencer 
27, uhhuh 
28, and he needs to know 
29, a whether there ll be more than one set up or just one set up 
30, just one 
31, now the set up would be you know everybody being photographed in
32, the same place 
33, yeah I know yeah just one 
34, one 
35, okay inhales and then he needs to kno 
36, but just tell him I want black velvet 
37, huh 
38, I want black velvet 
39, okay 
40, backdrop and that s that s it really 
41, okay 
42, okay 
43, and then 
44, lipsmack uh he needs to know how many different shots you
45, anticipate 
46, yeah 
47, I have to think about that 
48, okay okay 
49, we ll 
50, I told him how many rolls I wanted 
51, uhhuh 
52, um did he I told him I wanted ten two and a quarter 
53, okay okay 
54, but I think it might actually have to be more than ten 
55, mhm 
56, Well I mean obviously you know the expenses go up the more he
57, has to shoot 
58, You know what I mean 
59, yeah yeah 
60, Like there s a relationship between the number of rolls he shoots
61, and the cost of the whole 
62, oh yeah 
63, thing 
64, no I know well yeah because he has to take it to a place and
65, then got a contact all of them and 
66, right 
67, stuff like that 
68, right right inhales Well will all of it be black and white 
69, um 
70, yes 
71, yes alright 
72, and if it s not going to cost too much I d like to buy 
73, one of the rolls whichever roll is the nicest one 
74, uhhuh 
75, I d like to buy that roll 
76, uhhuh 
77, okay 
78, okay 
79, okay so you ll have to think about how many different shots there
80, would be 
81, like people setups 
82, mhm 
83, yeah 
84, okay 
85, and then do you actually want any photograph taken during the
86, ceremony itself 
87, I don t think so 
88, what do you think 
89, okay distorted 
90, I think it s tacky 
91, yeah 
92, no I don t think it either 
93, okay 
94, mommy never no mommy and I did not have any at all 
95, no 
96, I think it s just going to it s going to be hard enough and uh 
97, 
98, yeah right and this g 
99, I I don t need that 
100, right and because in that environment I don t I think you re right
101, on that I think it would be inhales awkward 
102, mhm 
103, um and so I think that s better actually so if yo if you know 
104, this way he could 
105, just take all the pictures he needs to take actually before the
106, ceremony itself 
107, mhm 
108, breath and what I would like to do 
109, which you know I heard about people doing elsewhere for the color
110, ones during the meal 
111, hm 
112, is you know put some of those disposable cameras on some tables
113, and let you know 
114, mhm mhm 
115, mhm 
116, because then I ll I ll be sure to get pictures from my friends and
117, stuff 
118, mhm mhm 
119, yeah that s good 
120, that s good everything 
121, What do you think of that 
122, yeah that s fine 
123, okay 
124, yeah I think that s fine 
125, mhm 
126, okay well I told him I would get back to him 
127, How many rolls did you tell him 
128, I told him ten two and a quarter but 
129, okay 
130, it s going to I think it s going to have to be more than that 
131, uhhuh 
132, like twelve to fifteen 
133, uhhuh 
134, yeah exhale 
135, okay 
136, lipsmack well anyway what you do have to think about is the
137, number of sort of people poses 
138, mhm 
139, yeah 
140, no I do 
141, uhhuh 
142, because I mean you know he he ah he has to allot enou enough
143, time in order to accomplish all of that 
144, mhm 
145, you know it s not as if and I mean I know what it s like at
146, Drexel you know when we have bunches of people getting their
147, pictures taken 
148, mhm 
149, uh it takes a while to get them appropriately set up you know and
150, you have to take several shots of each grouping and 
151, mhm 
152, all of that can take a considerable amount of time 
153, yeah 
154, yeah I ll I ll um I ll I ll think about all that 
155, yeah okay breath and uh distortion 
156, yeah I m also going to have a a list of stuff of music that I
157, want the D J to play 
158, yeah okay well you know any time you f inhales you could
159, probably let them know that when you come back here 
160, you think so 
161, I would think so 
162, okay 
163, I can call him and ask him ah but I but I think you can probably
164, let them know pretty close to the time itself 
165, okay 
166, but anyway we ll find out about that 
167, mm 
168, I um i you know the invitations have gone out along with all of
169, the information on travel in Philadelphia I sent a map 
170, mhm 
171, mhm 
172, lots of people can see how to get to the rt lliance you know 
173, oh that s nice dad 
174, uh for all the people out of from out of town 
175, uhhuh 
176, and then I also sent them information on hotels It turns out that
177, the arclay 
178, okay 
179, is actually the 
180, right next door 
181, it s actually the best deal because they ll give me the best deal
182, 
183, oh really wait hold on let me get a pen 
184, to write this down 
185, uhhuh 
186, okay 
187, I mean the arclay which is right across the street will
188, inhales 
189, Isn t it it s right next door right 
190, yeah right directly across the street 
191, okay 
192, um is um I think it s ninety nine dollars 
193, for a double and eighty nine dollars for a single is that what it
194, is lex 
195, yeah it s eighty nine for a single and ninety nine for a double 
196, 
197, okay did you check on triples or no 
198, ah no I didn t but I could do that easily 
199, okay 
200, uh I bic 
201, and at that that s a deal that s not um 
202, yeah that s not the regular price the regular price is a hundred
203, and twenty 
204, the regular rate 
205, okay so we re taking twenty dollars off 
206, yeah they re taking twenty dollars off 
207, okay 
208, at the Holiday Inn is actually the same price 
209, the Holiday Inn 
210, man that sounded cr yucky 
211, was um 
212, area 
213, was ninety nine dollars 
214, for a double without a continental breakfast and a hundred and
215, fourteen dollars with the continental breakfast I mean that s for
216, two 
217, m distorted 
218, so at at the arclay do you get breakfast 
219, no no that s the room 
220, okay 
221, okay 
222, the room cost is that 
223, okay 
224, okay 
225, mhm 
226, but I mean you know as perf as well as I do that all you if you
227, want to have a relatively inexpensive meal you walk up to Diner On
228, The Square two blocks away 
229, yeah 
230, exactly 
231, and so um you know in that area of Penn you can actually eat quite
232, expens inexpensively 
233, mhm 
234, uh because there are a lot of um of sian restaurants that you
235, can walk to within a couple of blocks 
236, mhm 
237, and so you know it s a it s a it 
238, no I mean there s Italian restaurants right around there too you
239, know 
240, yeah 
241, I mean there are lots of places where people could eat 
242, relatively inexpensively around the arclay 
243, yeah 
244, um and so that actually turned out to be the best deal 
245, okay 
246, lipsmack uh that could be arranged and so I you know sent a
247, written 
248, statement to all of the people from out of town indicating you know
249, what their options are 
250, okay 
251, and they all have the map as well 
252, okay 
253, okay 
254, so all of that is working out quite nicely 
255, okay 
256, um as it turns out the I think the um bed and breakfast is
257, cheaper that that 
258, okay well I can find out about that I didn t do that yet 
259, yeah did did you I should I give you the name of it 
260, The Reserve 
261, xxx Reserve 
262, yeah no I didn t do that one yet 
263, okay
