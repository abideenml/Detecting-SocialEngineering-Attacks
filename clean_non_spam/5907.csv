89, Now this has really been a good a week an laughs 
90, last eh let me see it started out with the coffee pot and it went
91, on the fritz 
92, and there was no way to fix it so they bought a new one 
93, breath then the vacuum cleaner 
94, was acting crazy and Lou fixed it 
95, laughs 
96, and then my stove laughs was going to make cornbread yet 
97, Your stove 
98, ooh 
99, and I opened it okay I had it preheating and I opened it up and
100, there was this great big white ball inside and I go 
101, Lou my stove is on fire laughs 
102, laughs 
103, So he came out and he threw some salt on it and it kept 
104, just this white ball of fire 
105, I mean it didn t have any flames or anything it was just white
106, ball 
107, and uh we finally shut it off 
108, nd today Mary and I went to Spokane and got a new element for it 
109, 
110, and I brought it home and we stuck it in and uh 
111, turned it on and it went oop 
112, oh no 
113, So I guess that when we had the big ball of white fire it did
114, something with the switch 
115, and I don t know if we blew the new sniff element in the bottom
116, or not 
117, oh darn
