17, You don t know that going into a job 
18, There s 
19, I understand that 
20, Well tha

27, crying 
28, Liz Liz I don t know whether you made a mistake or not 
29, I can t possibly tell 
30, breath 
31, nd I 
32, and I d I don t even have enough information to say whether you
33, did or not 
34, nd you will find out 
35, nd if it s a b huge mistake you ll just quit that s all 
36, You have no way of knowing breath

38, don t want that job 
39, No I didn t tell them anything

42, Sounded to me like a lot of interesting things 
43, Sounded to me like too much but it sounded like a very interesting
44, 
45, set of things 
46, Is that something you definitely d would not want to do 
47, laughs 
48, You had said that was an eas 
49, I 
50, You had said you had said that was an easier job in some ways 
51, What 
52, breath ctually I don t think so anymore because I think that
53, it s too many things 
54, breath re y are you going to have to for either one of them are
55, you going to have to spend hours preparing outside of the hours that
56, you actually get paid for 
57, breath I I don t know yet 
58, ecause I don t think that that would be warranted 
59, sniff 
60, at at at the salary that they re giving you 
61, I I think that you ought to be able to circumscribe your hours very
62, carefully 
63, breath 
64, I just got this call yesterday from this I mean I j 
65, Liz 
66, it was on a message on my machine when I came home from this
67, breath 
68, nurse at a high school 
69, nearby 
70, lipsmack 
71, saying I should call her about openings in the district that she
72, called me because 
73, of one of the letters I wrote to one of the principals 
74, breath 
75, oh yeah 
76, breath 
77, who knows what kinds of openings there are breath 
78, mhm 
79, mhm 
80, So may 
81, breath Lizzy I know how up in the a you know when I was in
82, graduate school I I spent a lot of time in my last year of c 
83, college 
84, thinking about whether w wanted to go into biophysics or wanted to
85, teach little kids 
86, nd 
87, I I knew it was obviously because what I really wanted to do was go
88, into biophysics but also have my own little kids 
89, ut I went into biophysics 
90, y the end of the year I d met Daddy and I decided that was going
91, to be it 
92, I really wanted to 
93, i I really Daddy was really going to be the one 
94, breath I got 
95, very unhappy with the science 
96, and 
97, I just walked out of one lab and I said no this is it 
98, I just don t want it 
99, I wanted to be teaching little kids 
100, ecause Daddy was at that point noncommittal 
101, to say the least 
102, nd um and he was also leaving for Syracuse 
103, nd so a friend of mine sat down with me Wayne Meyers and he said
104, he was a very bright 
105, guy 
106, He was the one I cried whose shoulder I cried on when I took
107, Dexadrin that time too for 
108, the doctor had given it to me for cramps and I 
109, ended up getting um depressed for twenty four hours 
110, um 
111, and 
112, he said to me 
113, you really want to change 
114, I said yeah I really want to go 
115, He says well take the bus across the river this afternoon 
116, breath 
117, because I had already applied and been accepted to the I mean it
118, went so far that I w I applied both to biophysics 
119, and to um Harvard School of Ed 
120, nd I didn t apply to any other ed schools because I figured I
121, could get in in there which I had 
122, nd I went across the river that day 
123, and I said can I get into your next year s class 
124, nd they said absolutely 
125, nd I mean by then it was like May 
126, Certainly pril 
127, Certainly pril not 
128, not not earlier 
129, breath 
130, nd 
131, I remember Mama Sadie was upset about it 
132, ut everybody knew why I was doing it and everybody kn e it was
133, obvious even to Daddy why I I just had to 
134, I had to do that for a while 
135, I couldn t just study science for a while 
136, nd 
137, I was twenty two 
138, twenty one 
139, nd and um 
140, yeah I guess I was twenty two already 
141, um and um 
142, a and 
143, and a a it s it s not any rational kind of thing Liz 
144, It s hormonal 
145, It s absolutely hormonal 
146, I mean here you are you are thirty 
147, nd it s no wonder 
148, it s no wonder that that that you don t know what you want to do 
149, I didn t know what I wanted to do at that stage 
150, Well I did but it was out of reach 
151, nd for you it s obviously out of reach too 
152, Unless it works out with Matt 
153, you haven t met him 
154, nd therefore 
155, I m I m 
156, I I breath 
157, I I m disappointed in how you re going about it 
158, because I don t see I don t see I mean breath 
159, I I I I I ve I ve known so many people who didn t get married and
160, so many people who got married too late to have children 
161, It s very 
162, sad 
163, I find it very sad 
164, I didn t expect that I would be in this position 
165, with my children 
166, Well 
167, actually I expected it with Jonathan 
168, I expected to worry about him not you 
169, because he was very slow socially 
170, nd and and you know you never can tell with life 
171, There aren t any rules about it 
172, and uh th nobody has nobody has written the future 
173, nd it s not really it s it s uh eh prayer and uh 
174, eh penitence doesn t really help 
175, It s going to happen things are going to happen when it happen
176, they happen 
177, ut you have to breath there there are ways to help them along 
178, There are ways to help them along 
179, nd maybe you re doing them but I don t see it 
180, I know you went out with some guy the other night 
181, May maybe you are looking actively but I I don t see it 
182, So all I can do is sit and worry 
183, and be concerned 
184, and 
185, I don t 
186, think that you would 
187, Can we talk about the job things now 
188, that breath 
189, breath Well what about the job things 
190, I I can t talk about them 
191, I don t know anything about them 
192, You want to tell me about them 
193, Well you don t like the job I just took 
194, breath Now wait a moment 
195, Don t 
196, Well Daddy says they re less important than the other stuff and I
197, agree 
198, ut don t tell me I don t like the job you just took Lizzy 
199, I don t know enough about it 
200, You know I raised you and

204, ten hours in the school district doing something else siren 
205, Maybe you can 
206, eh it s it s 
207, that would be that would be interesting if 
208, you know you have hours during the week that are available 
209, Don t don t don t block them out until you find out whether or not
210, you can take a a an art course during the week 
211, breath

226, Lizzy you might not 
227, I haven t figured out mine yet 
228, You re a scientist 
229, I m a scientist Liz that s a pretty poor showing for a scientist 
230, 
231, Ma are you kidding 
232, Look how many days you go into the lab 
233, I know 
234, Look what I ve published 
235, One paper 
236, So who cares about publishing 
237, Well that s what otherwise otherwise I I m I m cooking and
238, nobody s eating it 
239, It s it s recycling it s 
240, it s work working that nobody nobody ever knows about 
241, That s not what defines me as a person 
242, What defines me as a person is is is my family 
243, breath 
244, nd your failure daughter 
245, That s what I m feeling sad about at the moment 
246, I just I m not going to be able to figure out what I want to do 
247, I just didn t know 
248, I thought this might be interesting okay 
249, nd and maybe 
250, breath That s fine

280, You want to count your degrees 
281, You want to count the courses you ve had 
282, You want to count the work you ve done the jobs you ve had 
283, That s nonsense 
284, I don t know 
285, Like maybe if I were a teacher then I would breath 
286, Everybody always 
287, you know and I taught 
288, say 
289, health science and art then I would sort of get this body of
290, knowledge that I would have and this 
291, Lizzy 
292, structure to it 
293, nd then I 
294, yeah yeah Lizzy Lizzy
