154, nd I ve got a net worth statement now and it s breath 
155, I m surp I m just is 
156, I m just surprised to learn that my net worth is increasing every
157, month you know because e when I count the stuff up that breath 
158, 
159, like there s eight hundred and ten dollars every month 
160, increased equity in the breath 
161, huh 
162, the building 
163, Wow

170, now but breath 
171, xxx 
172, There s breath future stuff if thing you know if 
173, mhm

175, manage to get the m equity out of the building without giving it
176, all to 
177, taxes laughs 
178, yeah 
179, that s where that s going to be a big problem 
180, lipsmack 
181, So um

184, I m just trying to learn about money breath 
185, uhhuh 
186, nd and it s it s not that hard 
187, breath 
188, I still don t know about 
189, price expense ratios and st some of the stuff just doesn t
190, compute like breath 
191, you should buy bonds when interest rates are 
192, coming down

203, Learning computers and riding a bicycle and worrying about money
204, and stuff breath lipsmack 
205, mhm lipsmack hm 
206, So breath 
207, um I e I feel pretty good 
208, This thing with Jerry m it was made me upset 
209, I was I guess mostly I was j 
210, beating myself up over it 
211, Well here s another relationship 
212, breath 
213, ut you know I never did take him seriously as a 
214, marriage partner after the first month or two 
215, xxx 
216, nd 
217, ut 
218, I was comfortable and I enjoyed being with him for the most part 
219, breath 
220, lthough the circumstances have changed now 
221, He just 
222, he s standing on a shrinking iceberg talking about his big plans
223, you know breath 
224, He s probably going to end up living with his mother breath Like
225, me but 
226, mhm 
227, lipsmack 
228, you know d raggedy assed n and um breath 
229, breath 
230, So does he like you say it s over but does he know that 
231, breath 
232, oh 
233, Have you talked about it or is he like sort of assuming that you re
234, just going to always be there 
235, We can go out you know it was 
236, e 
237, indefinitely as far as I m concerned 
238, ut I have no plans to be with him for the future 
239, I don t have any plans not to be with him either breath 
240, ut 
241, I don t know if he s going to get bummed out by this breath 
242, mhm 
243, Or he s said the other day in when he was in a kind of a crappy
244, mood he says he wants all or nothing in a relationship 
245, lipsmack 
246, oh 
247, Well that s a strong statement laughs 
248, nd if he 
249, if he presses it then I guess I ll have to say it ll be nothing 
250, uh uh 
251, breath 
252, mm 
253, nd breath I have never been 
254, groan 
255, terribly involved in his financial problems breath 
256, ut 
257, I find I do things that I m going to try stopping 
258, Like I breath 
259, I m afraid of being alone 
260, nd so I asked him if he wanted to go to this id banquet and I I 
261, 
262, told him I d buy us tickets 
263, You know now really he ought to buy his own damn tickets 
264, mhm 
265, breath 
266, nd there s no reason why I should buy it 
267, ut I just wanted to make sure he d go 
268, mhm 
269, So I m going to stop doing stuff like that 
270, nd if he 
271, doesn t want to go then I ll go with somebody else 
272, lipsmack well that s the thing the thing about being alone 
273, I mean it is hard 
274, It is hard breath I ve been alone a lot breath 
275, yeah 
276, nd I I kept meeting these men that 
277, I mean I was really wanting to meet somebody and breath 
278, I kept meeting these men and then 
279, trying them out and then it didn t work out 
280, You know I d like hope I d keep hoping breath 
281, nd I got pretty good at ending the r these things after about
282, three months laughs nd I just kept 
283, mm 
284, meeting people just ending them breath 
285, nd uh yes it s it s hard it s hard 
286, ut like I enjoy being alone too though 
287, yeah I guess 
288, yeah well 
289, It got less scary after a while 
290, breath 
291, lipsmack 
292, yeah well I am going to have to 
293, come to terms with that 
294, ecause I have basically had a man in my life for the past past
295, thirty five years breath 
296, I f f figure that in July nineteen ninety one I was alone for
297, three weeks 
298, laughs 
299, and up till I ve always had some man around 
300, mhm 
301, nd breath 
302, maybe it s time to give that a look breath 
303, lipsmack yeah because 
304, I don t know I I 
305, breath 
306, I really started to enjoy 
307, not 
308, needing somebody 
309, mhm 
310, nd uh 
311, I felt really good 
312, Not meeting somebody 
313, Not needing somebody 
314, Needing somebody 
315, yeah 
316, yeah 
317, breath 
318, nd like e e I could just turn my attention to other things 
319, w 
320, Well some of my friends are telling me that I don t need a man 
321, nd I I know that 
322, ut on some level I don t 
323, yeah

336, You know stuff like that it s nice to have a it s nice to have a

384, big thing because breath 
385, 
386, exp hollow rattling 
387, the house has been a mess and then h 
388, then the house has been really a mess and then then he spent like
389, hours putting up these shelves and I I was getting really pissed off
390, because I was doing most of the cleaning breath 
391, So I I started getting in this argument with him 
392, nd he got mad because he s been working on the shelves breath 
393, 
394, nd I can t do the shelves 
395, I don t know how to do the shelves

398, End
399,
