220, distortion 
221, It gets robbed distortion from you though like 
222, yeah 
223, nd I mean I don t want to say that we trusted the wrong people
224, because 
225, yeah 
226, I mean I really believe that David is a good person 
227, Right 
228, nd like 
229, t first I like when he first told me I was just like David you

231, you made your decision and 
232, Right 
233, There is nothing else to talk about so 
234, Well I think in a way he was trying to tell you something by doing
235, that 
236, You know 
237, oh yeah xxx he s totally like unhappy by 
238, what was going on because he basically he wanted to be together 
239, Right 
240, He wanted like he needed a sexual relationship 
241, yeah 
242, nd he needed me to be there and he needed to like someone
243, nurturing and all that crap and I just wasn t doing it and I know
244, that 
245, Right 
246, Right 
247, Like I was really hard on him I was always telling him that we
248, weren t like working out I was always saying I didn t want to be
249, with him laughs I mean 
250, nd so like 
251, He did me the biggest favor though and that s why like I got over
252, him really quickly it s kind of funny 
253, Really 
254, ec yeah because 
255, lipsmack like at first it was really devastating 
256, Right 
257, Like it was so weird because the difference between Josh and him
258, like Josh was devastating for a long time for me 
259, Right 
260, Even though he wasn t as nearly 
261, s like I never had as m many as deep feelings for him 
262, Right 
263, nd it never like was as serious in many ways 
264, mhm 
265, ut with David it was like I think because I had been in pain for
266, so long with like 
267, yeah distortion 
268, problems with my parents and problems with him and all this
269, pressure 
270, yeah distortion 
271, That by the time he finally cheated on me I just realized 
272, Well at first I didn t because I I had to okay interesting so I
273, told him goodbye and then 
274, lipsmack he called me again like a day later or two and we talked
275, things over and then he called me again we talked things over and so
276, I decided that I could forgive him 
277, mhm 
278, mm 
279, Right 
280, nd we could still be going out because I still loved him and I
281, could understand 
282, How it happened because of the situation 
283, mhm 
284, ut I I told him I still thought it was still shitty and horrible
285, and whatever 
286, mhm 
287, but that I could forgive him 
288, but it would take a long time to trust him distortion 
289, God Liz distortion that s so rational of you I can t believe you
290, laughs 
291, No no no but it was though and I really did like forgive him 
292, mhm 
293, It was like you know I thought 
294, about the whole thing and I m d and besides many times I had
295, thought about cheating too because I like 
296, I just couldn t understand that part of him really well you know
