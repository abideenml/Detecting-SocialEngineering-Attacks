1, What should we talk about 
2, laughs 
3, Well I don t know 
4, Tell me what s going on in merica 
5, I haven t seen the news in ages 
6, com line static 
7, Really 
8, You did d 
9, In the merican news I mean I know what s going on in Russia but 
10, 
11, yeah 
12, Well let s see 
13, What s going on 
14, uh 
15, You want me to just give you some headlines 
16, yeah 
17, Give me some headlines 
18, What s Clinton up to 
19, lipsmack breath up 
20, yeah 
21, I was just going to say Clinton just came out yesterday with his uh
22, his statement concerning affirmative action 
23, uhhuh 
24, nd and basically he has in the past said that he was not in favor
25, of uh 
26, you know of making um al allowances strictly based on race 
27, but at the same time uh the analysis in the news 
28, breath shall we say the conservative analysis in the news is that
29, 
30, Clinton just came out and said that he doesn t believe in quota
31, systems 
32, and in reverse discrimination but that he does believe that
33, affirmative action 
34, is necessary inhales to move uh you know black mericans
35, inhale 
36, forward and to give them the opportunities that they ve been
37, denied 
38, So he s trying to k kind of walking a tight rope 
39, You know what I m saying 
40, Right 
41, In other words breath l 
42, He s trying to please everybody 
43, yeah 
44, Let s see if we can make everybody happy laughing laugh 
45, laughs 
46, I think that he s 
47, Then he just ends up making nobody happy 
48, I think you re right laughs ecause you know affirmative action
49, is really under attack in the United States on 
50, from many different quarters right now 
51, nd and it s a big breath 
52, it s a big issue because it s supposed to be a gender I mean not a
53, gender a race 
54, uh color blind we re supposed to be race color blind and yet
55, breath it s like contractors 
56, that are bidding you know with a high bid or higher than 
57, the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they
58, are of ethnic protected you know black or whatever 
59, nd it s really you know 
60, Right 
61, nd then then so they re taking lawsuits to the Supreme Court and
62, all of this so it s breath 
63, Wow 
64, nother thing that just came up was that the Supreme Court said
65, that the redistricting of the congressional districts one of which
66, is in Georgia 
67, violated the Constitution because it was based primarily on race 
68, There was you know a new 
69, What did they do i They were doing it because they were trying to
70, make it more e like they were trying to make it less segregated 
71, They were trying to make the district majority black mericans so
72, therefore they drew it uh all the way across the state 
73, You see what I m saying 
74, oh right 
75, uhhuh 
76, a a very narrow district and it created a majority black district
77, which then elected 
78, a a black representative and then it was challenged because it
79, said well the only reason that it has been done this way is just to
80, ensure that it was 
81, majority black inhales and that s not 
82, right 
83, you know 
84, Hello 
85, I m here 
86, okay breath nyway 
87, I m mulling all this over 
88, yeah 
89, I mean it s it 
90, So it s interesting because today we had a discussion with students
91, about um 
92, because we re doing a pre departure orientation so we were we had
93, our hot topics 
94, discussion today where we break in small groups and we talked about
95, like political correctness 
96, and racial prejudice and sexual harrassment feminism and 
97, just like different topics that they might encounter in merica
98, where the people have different attitudes than here in Russia 
99, So that was one of the things kind of like that distortion 
100, ut I have I m not really up on what the attitude is in merica
101, because I haven t been there in so long laughs 
102, Well there s a lot of frustration I think over the fact that
103, there re there re a number of evidences that the affirmative action
104, 
105, program is in fact discriminating in the other direction and people
106, are saying wait a minute 
107, Why don t we just give everybody uh 
108, uh uh an e try to give everybody an equal shot and if someone
109, feels that they ve been discriminated against because of their race
110, breath 
111, go at it from the standpoint of of trying to remedy it through the
112, courts breath 
113, rather than saying that government has to give X number of
114, contracts to minority no matter what 
115, Right 
116, nd as a result some uh m some people are getting contracts just
117, because 
118, of the color of their skin and you know what I m saying it s it s 
119, it s still 
120, When they might not even be the most qualified 
121, e either them they re they re not even they re not the low bid 
122, 
123, you know normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the
124, quality spec specification 
125, Right 
126, nd but now you ve there have been several cases where clearly you
127, know it was 
128, they didn t get it because laughs they just didn t weren t the
129, right color skin 
130, So now is that 
131, Right 
132, is that really remedying the situation or is it s creating a lot of
133, uh of uh resentment 
134, nd uh 
135, Right 
136, it s kind of too bad 
137, How long 
138, God what a mess 
139, oh it s a mess 
140, It really is 
141, W how long have you been there by the way 
142, Over here 
143, um it ll be three years in November
