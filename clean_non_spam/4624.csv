88, That s the best thing about it breath 
89, It s free 
90, yeah 
91, Wow 
92, yeah 
93, You just have to find the means to get there right 
94, for some reason I 
95, yeah I I am going to take the train I think 
96, oh 
97, mm So you re still going to go to the xxx breath 
98, yeah I want to actually a little I mean eh Robin already like paid
99, for everything so I feel really bad if I don t go and I think he s
100, kind of counting on me to go too so 
101, yeah 
102, I m just going to go 
103, I all I have to do is find a way to get there which I haven t found
104, yet and it s really 
105, oh really 
106, yeah it s coming up really soon 
107, ecause I thought you got 
108, I don t think I ll take a plane there but uh I don t know a bus
109, or a train or something 
110, oh because I know that I mean if you got here you could probably
111, ride with Robin 
112, yeah I was thinking of that too but I don t even 
113, ut that will probably cost the same just to come here as 
114, yeah 
115, I brought like she said she was driving alone so I wouldn t mind
116, like I even said to her you know I ll come there and then I can
117, drive with you 
118, yeah actually I kind of probably I mean is she driving there by
119, herself 
120, yeah 
121, yeah because because I don t I mean I think she s okay right now
122, but it would be much better if she didn t have to drive by herself 
123, 
124, yeah I think so too I I think that s you know I want to do that
125, but I think she doesn t want me to go through all that trouble 
126, yeah 
127, but I told her it s no big deal 
128, I figure xxx take the bus or the train there and then we can drive
129, down together you know 
130, yeah I mean I think that would be nice 
131, I mean just cau and also because it is nice to go like if you are
132, going to a big place not to go along because 
133, yeah 
134, because who knows how hard it ll be to find somebody once you re
135, there 
136, right and I ll be alone I I won t know anything 
137, yeah 
138, nd she s been here before like to the conference but I don t know
139, if she s been to ohi o Ohio right 
140, yeah distorted 
141, yeah 
142, It s in Columbus 
143, yeah and also I m kind of worried about her because like you d I
144, don t know if she talked to you about her health 
145, yeah she has 
146, yeah eh yeah 
147, yeah because there s I mean like a like last a c few weeks ago she
148, was like losing control of her hand and uh now she s on some kind
149, of medication that s like put it back like she can use her hands
150, again 
151, mhm 
152, ut she s like she had to have her hand bandaged up and stuff and
153, like she was having a real hard time at work 
154, so that would me nervous like if she was going to drive by herself
155, you know like what happens you know if something cooky goes wrong
156, with her hand 
157, and she can t drive but I guess she s at she s taking some
158, medication now so I guess it s okay but 
159, hm 
160, yeah I tried calling her tonight but I got her answering machine
161, so I left her a message to her 
162, hm breath 
163, She calls me back I ll tell her that s what I ll do because I was
164, thinking about that too but you know she like throws it off make it
165, seems like it s no big deal so and I think oh well but um 
166, well just tell her that you d prefer her company or something th 
167, then then it won t be like you know she doesn t want to put you out
168, for um you know inconvenience but 
169, if you make it sound like you want to do it then she ll probably
170, agree 
171, yeah 
172, yeah 
173, So y you still are not thinking of going right 
174, breath 
175, No I think not 
176, yeah 
177, yeah I mean because even before all that weird stuff you know I ve
178, been talking about I ve always like had a kind of weird feeling
179, about them anyway breath 
180, xxx 
181, I mean the whole organization just because I don t know it seems
182, kind of strange like um I don t know it s hard to hard to explain
183, but just real um xxx 
184, Like someone xxx me today and she said it would be like a you know
185, she said you know we should really go to a conference you know as a
186, group because I ll be living with like four or five sisters this
187, fall who rented a place 
188, yeah breath 
189, and so she said um you know it would be nice if we could go to a
190, conference but it would have to be all females because she hears
191, that some of them are meat markets so I mea I I ve heard other th 
192, 
193, oh really breath 
194, yeah 
195, nd I was like whoa I didn t you know I didn t even think of that
196, but it s kind of true 
197, a lot of eh 
198, People looking for a xxx distortion 
199, eligible women right laughs 
200, yeah 
201, in one place but I don t know I don t know 
202, mm 
203, If I hate the experience then I ll never go to another one but if
204, it turns out to be okay then I you know it s okay 
205, yeah 
206, I mean I heard that it s like real I mean that it that it is
207, enjoyable you know people talk about you know religious things and
208, get really into it and stuff 
209, yeah 
210, um I guess that w what I had heard bad about it was just that they
211, were so into talking about like um the Koran and stuff but they
212, that they weren t using this as being like a tool for social change
213, at all like they weren t talking about what we could possibly do 
214, mm 
215, s Muslims to like improve the world but rather just well just
216, spend all your time praying kind of philosophy breath 
217, oh 
218, nd um so e 
219, Nine thousand people and that s it huh 
220, huh 
221, I said nine thousand people and that s all they tau and that s all
222, they find to do with that you know they have like uh uh a large
223, group of people they could really make a difference but they I
224, don t know I haven t been to one so I d 
225, yeah yeah I haven t been to it either so I can t really talk 
226, mm 
227, ut yeah I think that they just don t want to get really radical
228, 
229, Right 
230, for whatever re I mean because I guess like Saudi rabia funds it
231, a lot and um 
232, yeah th they were talking about the go xxx zum is that hi the
233, person s name zarahim I ve never heard of like this person 
234, yeah I ve never heard of him either 
235, and they said that he s like a crim he s a murderer and stuff like
236, that 
237, yeah 
238, I don t know 
239, nd then there s the Mike Tyson thing that a lot of us have 
240, laughs 
241, not too you know happy about that 
242, yeah 
243, nd uh 
244, Well it will be interesting to see what he has to say breath 
245, yeah 
246, laughs 
247, Did you read my post like what I wrote about him and stuff like 
248, That he was talking about his girlfriend or something 
249, yeah he s talking about well I can t even kiss my girlfriend and I
250, was like no you don t do that to your girlfriend what is that 
251, So it was it s like he doesn t really know I don t know 
252, He I mean that s what he doesn t even have the basics down you know
253, 
254, like I think I m like we were at the beginning stage like I am 
255, 
256, exhale 
257, I I have the basics down and that s it but he doesn t even have
258, that that like I I mean before I xxx that there was no like
259, girlfriend boyfriend thing and every 
260, you know and other stuff 
261, No pork any of that stuff but it s like laughs he s just you know
262, 
263, exhale 
264, yeah I 
265, out of it 
266, He doesn t have control over his life 
267, That s what I think and so you know when people rag on him I I I
268, tend to take the 
269, like the side of you know like Mike Tyson because he really doesn t
270, know 
271, I mean he knew what he did but it s it 
272, not all him you know 
273, Other people control him and tell him what to do and where to spend
274, his money and stuff like that 
275, yeah I mean I generally j hur just stay away from the T V anyway 
276, 
277, yeah I m a distortion T V magnet laughs distorted 
278, So I never know about these things except for when people talk
279, about it laughs 
280, I m a T V magnet 
281, So um I forgot what you did you re a grad student right 
282, No actually I m the uh eternal bachelor s student 
283, You re a what 
284, bachelor s or undergrad or whatever you call it 
285, oh really 
286, yeah 
287, What year are you 
288, laughs Working on laughs I think this is my fifth year laughs
289, 
290, oh really 
291, oh that s not bad 
292, I ll 
293, laughs 
294, I ll be a fifth year 
295, I mean I won t be one next year but it s going to get to that point
296, laughs I can t finish my major in in three years 
297, I m going to need three because my first two years I I can t tell
298, you what I did with those 
299, yeah distorted 
300, So uh it s like I m in the same boat too 
301, yeah what do you ma 
302, ut you ve already graduated though right 
303, What 
304, You ve already graduated right 
305, No see I m working on like three degrees at one time so it s going
306, to be another three years before I graduate 
307, oh 
308, Unless I just decide to give up and just take what I ve got 
309, So what do you have so far 
310, or do you 
311, Well right now if I I could graduate with a German degree right now
312, 
313, mhm 
314, but German degree is useless 
315, Right 
316, Unless you get a P h D or something 
317, mhm 
318, So I m also working on an English degree breath because that s
319, my real interest breath 
320, You really English literature and not li literature right 
321, yeah well what I really really love is like medieval stuff 
322, oh wow 
323, and that s why I really think that like eng English and German
324, goes together really well i if you re interested in medieval 
325, mm 
326, because um in the past English and German used to be the same
327, language like about the year before the year seven hundred 
328, Wow 
329, You know because like in Europe it was all like wandering pagan
330, tribes and they just like um they came you know they came down the
331, Goths and all them breath 
332, mhm 
333, like they used to I mean they spoke Germanic language and some of
334, them settled in Germany and some people kept on walking and kept on
335, going to England and so the language gradually changed after that 
336, 
337, Wow 
338, End
339,
