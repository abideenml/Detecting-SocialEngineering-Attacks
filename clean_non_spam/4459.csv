,0
0,so he said to let your wife do it you know distorted 
1, uh right 
2, he says I 
3, uh you know no I m going to eh so now I m at a point that it s very
4, strange like I can t 
5, I won t complain about anything or I can t complain about anything
6, and I can t 
7, ask him to come help me in the middle of the night when I forgot to
8, take out something they put in the freezer 
9, So we ll see how it goes hopefully I mean 
10, they promise me you know everybody that they re going to help me
11, and that whatever I say 
12, ut you know everybody gives you these l uh these uh pro 
13, yeah so you ve already started 
14, Well I ve started working with Du 
15, like I I don t cook anymore I haven t worked in the kitchen kitchen
16, for a week already I ve been just 
17, doing with him learning how to do the orders and meeting all the um
18, 
19, sales people and 
20, um I ve learned how to work the computer which is the bigges 
21, laughing I said I don t know how to turn it on even 
22, really distorted 
23, So I m not I don t know if I could do it yet by myself but he s
24, showing me teaching me 
25, and I think like 
26, the middle of nex this week he ll be there a few days with me and
27, then anoth 
28, he um 
29, Maybe here and there but he s really basically xxx 
30, What is he going to do 
31, He s going to be a teacher for um 
32, High school computers 
33, oh okay 
34, yeah so he s only teaching three days a week so he always says that
35, on the other days if I need him he ll come in 
36, the truth is he s been teaching and very 
37, patient and very good and he also is great that he has written down
38, everything 
39, I m sure he s thrilled to get out of there 
40, Well I ll tell you the truth uh 
41, I mean now that I worked with him one to one 
42, He does do everything with his heart I mean it s not he he s just 
43, 
44, he has a different head than everybody else like I know that he
45, wants everything to be nice and to be good and 
46, laughs 
47, but he s very separate and he only he doesn t like to listen to
48, other people s 
49, um ideas 
50, but um 
51, I m sure financially he was probably great for the kibbutz s yid 
52, 
53, because he was cheap 
54, yeah because he s also I ll tell you I worked with him this whole
55, week he doesn t eat a thing ever 
56, like all morning long so he doesn t eat 
57, he doesn t drink coffee he he do I didn t see him drink anything 
58, 
59, water or anything else one day he said I better drink something I
60, have a headache because it was really hot 
61, laughs 
62, laughs 
63, but I mean you know he doesn t eat anything and then for lunch when
64, we finally went to go get something to eat 
65, lso he eats like a little 
66, What we would eat maybe half 
67, for a meal and that s it 
68, so I can understand now why he thinks that xxx because he doesn t
69, have big eyes you know 
70, right that s so funny 
71, but anyway no so he had agreed to do it for a year and his year is
72, over I 
73, are you excited at all about it or 
74, well I ll tell you the truth until I made the decision I was 
75, scared and also utz I miss the cooking part 
76, You miss it that s funny 
77, I 
78, yeah yeah like this week even when they made the c the 
79, um coleslaw 
80, you know they kept xxx kept calling me to taste it and make sure
81, that it was the way that I do it 
82, and so Matty said to me Ellen you didn t make the coleslaw I said
83, xxx it s over you know I can t 
84, laughs 
85, laughs 
86, I can t do everything 
87, tha but 
88, and they re going to notice that the cooking is different 
89, Well that s what even Ruthie says you know everyone thinks that the
90, economy is so important but there s a lot of things that are 
91, very important of running the kitchen and we ll see uh right now
92, Ramon uh 
93, you know Cocoa she got married 
94, She married that guy 
95, n the not the Israeli guy not the Sephardic guy but 
96, No you re kidding

114, oh my god 
115, why did they allow that

117, was 
118, originally when she came to her parents and she was going to get
119, married she was going to get married in October 
120, but she got engaged like before Pesach 
121, so xxx going to get married in October so they weren t so thrilled

172, them that they got engaged and the wedding is in June and they were
173, so angry 
174, because how the hell could they come back after xxx distortion
