209, around you know 
210, lipsmack breath really 
211, Real really 
212, yeah 
213, nd apparently she breath uh eh my impression is they re not

215, they were struggling just a little bit uh that s Elsa and her
216, husband breath when the babies were little 
217, Well 
218, you know the big family like that right 
219, yeah breath and she couldn t have been working very much at that
220, point if at all 
221, Either right right 
222, yeah 
223, breath nd so probably one uh income just you know was making it
224, 
225, eh makes it hard of course 
226, yeah you know 
227, breath Now isn t there another daughter or don t 
228, lipsmack Is is it another daughter or another son

233, I think it seems to me another child 
234, breath uh I m positive you re right eh it just registered 
235, Right 
236, It it seems to me they may even have said something about him but I
237, never met the third one so you know I don t have 
238, mhm 
239, mhm 
240, it didn t r i stick with me whatever they said 
241, That was nice to see family you know uh over the years it s very
242, interesting 
243, mhm 
244, Isn t it 
245, mhm 
246, Do you ever see be

251, 
252, That I remember 
253, yeah 
254, yeah like a walking skeleton 
255, mhm 
256, nd the only time I see him now is if I call and ask them to come 
257, 
258, mhm 
259, and I don t think now that you mention it it s been about a year 
260, mhm 
261, efore you know when he was still quite well he would occasionally
262, drop in 
263, mhm 
264, because their daughter lives 
265, mhm 
266, I think actually on the eastern part of the city 
267, mhm 
268, y Not in Detroit but you know it s not Warren Sterling Heights I
269, don t know something like that 
270, w yeah 
271, yeah yeah 
272, yeah yeah oh 
273, So if he was going to visit her he would you know occasionally stop
274, in here on his way home 
275, Sure 
276, Sure 
277, ut since he s been ill he doesn t seem to do that 
278, I think I m not sure whether Linda g that their daughter is Linda

282, with this man for a long while but they tell me he works at Chrysler
