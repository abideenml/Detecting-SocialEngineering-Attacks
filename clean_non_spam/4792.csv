36, yeah 
37, uh you know after I taught at that university and I don t in a
38, way I don t envy him 
39, yeah 
40, no the E S L people are are second class citizens

62, two thirds of them failed 
63, so I gave them the same questions almost all the same questions

65, and half of them failed so sometimes you have to give them the
66, same questions three times laughs

102, oh yeah 
103, so there s a ne 
104, there are I I was looking at a Korean ah merican bulletin board 
105, and there is some sort of Korean system out that s been developed in
106, the States I don t know what 
107, no no this this is the professor who developed this one is 
108, yeah 
109, uh the one in the States is probably to work on Unix or something
110, you know the ah its a it s difficult to send messages in Korean
111, across the internet

116, messages and get all these nonsense characters on my screen 
117, well well there are yeah well there are some ah there is some
118, going on because ah some of the on the Korean bulletin board some
119, of the messages you pick it up and get just um 
120, you know it what amounts to code it looks like ah the Rutgers
121, system is ah I only discovered that there s certain unmarked
122, computers that will receive pictures and if 
123, they don t receive pictures and you either get a message that we
124, can t accept this or instead of um instead of a picture you ll get
125, alphabet and numbers you know laughs its sort of over and over
126, again 
127, yeah mhm 
128, and ah some of the Korean messages have been like that and and ah 
129, apparently they re they re not pornographic they re just um it s
130, it s the ah 
131, xxx you could probably decode it if you could you know work out
132, the laughs sit down and work out the pattern but ah 
133, there is they are sending some kind the Korean mericans are
134, using some kind of system here 
135, yeah they probably dual serve anyway this this new thing is for
