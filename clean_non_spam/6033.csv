15, p um 
16, I mean picks up well 
17, inhales she re she 
18, she started when I did and last March 
19, she had studied for two months 
20, oh 
21, in the states 
22, and then this summer sh 
23, before 
24, oh 
25, uh uh she went back and studied again inhales and the way they
26, studied uh they concentrate on 
27, speaking and vocabulary so she s done extremely well 
28, lipsmack wow my 
29, but she s she s also about thirty five years old laughs 
30, oh laughs but you know 
31, a and a teacher laughs 
32, oh okay but there is something about um 
33, you know you have it or you don t 
34, you know 
35, I think that s true 
36, th th it s a gift because um my niece Suzy 
37, you know she had learned German in uh high school 
38, mhm 
39, and then she got a scholarship to Germany 
40, so her first year of college was in Germany 
41, mhm 
42, and then when she came back 
43, mhm 
44, um she continued at um 
45, U W Madison 
46, and while she was there she meets a guy from 
47, mhm 
48, Holland 
49, hm 
50, well they re married now 
51, you know 
52, but they went together for a couple of years you know while he was
53, here and then his time was up and he he went back and then he came
54, here and 
55, and within um 
56, I would say about a half a year or something like that maybe a year
57, 
58, then she took Dutch 
59, you know 
60, mhm my gosh 
61, and speaks that very fluently 
62, and I thought well gee I didn t get that laughs 
63, laughs 
64, you know so she knows German and and Dutch ah 
65, a and it just flows she just flows 
66, you know xxx distorted 
67, yeah I think there s some relationship 
68, between German and Dutch you know I think if you learn German 
69, I I just have a feeling you can probably pick up Dutch 
70, with I had asked her about that but there s distorted uh 
71, uh 
72, No 
73, ye to some extent but then you have to know which is which 
74, oh I see 
75, I you know maybe maybe lamp uh lamp in one and lamp in the other
76, 
77, uhhuh 
78, you know I think 
79, uhhuh 
80, e she said there were some words like that 
81, but it is if you want to say like a different language 
82, yeah yeah 
83, hm 
84, I mean you know

147, oh 
148, thundering and lightning and the snow is blowing 
149, it was an unusual um 
150, I forgot what do they call it 
151, some kind of a 
152, snowstorm I guess they called it 
153, but it 
154, yeah when you have lightning that s unusual 
155, yes now I didn t see any of the lightning 
156, directly 
157, but um I did you know how out of the corner of your eye 
158, you know you can 
159, uhhuh 
160, you can sense 
161, you know it all lit up 
162, I saw in in the snow 
163, uhhuh

167, uh 
168, you know one of the weather guys saying you know how he 
169, he actually saw it and it was fantastic 
170, It had to be because it would come through the snowflakes you know
171, 
172, mm 
173, mhm 
174, well then um 
175, it was our power kept going off because the snow was so heavy 
176, and so I I think it was maybe uh you know pulling the lines down
177, or so 
178, Sure I bet it was 
179, and then 
180, yeah and this is you know I work at Saint Catherine s and that s

182, you know near the lake 
183, it takes me twenty minutes to work 
184, it s a good twenty minutes you know when I drive 
185, mhm 
186, okay so the power kept 
187, going on and off and then the sister said 
188, uh they had to wait until that power really came on 
189, um but they told me they said you better go home 
190, you know and this was shortly after two thirty okay
