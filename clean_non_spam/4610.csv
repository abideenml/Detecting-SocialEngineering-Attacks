11, until when 
12, Like the fifth or sixth I mean 
13, ach

15, Lord 
16, yeah no it s it s n yeah I th 
17, I don t I don t you know I I don t think it s going to be a big
18, deal uh I really kind of st doubt that Michelle will 
19, will be ready to go static um you know she was already
20, talking about sort of middle of September 
21, um in the beginning of the spring 
22, oh god 
23, yeah but she s c she couldn t she s got more leeway than you I
24, think 
25, yeah but I ve got so much more going for me than she does 
26, I know breath 
27, breath You know in the in the larger scheme 
28, If they don t tenure you we ll sue them 
29, We won t sue them but no anyway so 
30, It ll work out but anyway I m I m so I m I I mean I caught myself
31, today just getting a little sort of 
32, Edgy 
33, yeah 
34, Well look um 
35, ut but 
36, If you change your mind and you want to just come right up to
37, Windsor and um finesse the move we can do that 
38, No 
39, No I don t want to do that 
40, I don t want to do that 
41, It ll because I it ll be better to do the move right away anyway
42, because I m I you know I can t come home and go right to work I just
43, can t do that 
44, You ll be exhausted yeah 
45, yeah and I won t want to do it 
46, I won t be able to concentrate 
47, Right whereas we can do things 
48, Whereas spending together time together 
49, com echo of other channel 
50, and moving and settling in 
51, while moving is is fine 
52, com echo of other channel 
53, yeah 
54, yeah 
55, ll right well um 
56, I g I guess we ll have to figure out our respective movements when
57, when it gets closer but I m going to um shfield with Greg 
58, uhhuh 
59, tomorrow 
60, distortion uhhuh 
61, nd um 
62, Stay up there 
63, Well Greg and Jim uh Jimco and the kids are leaving for Japan
64, tomorrow 
65, uhhuh 
66, and um 
67, uh Greg s going to go up on a hiking trip with a friend 
68, uhhuh 
69, but he s going to um 
70, stop by shfield to drop off the dogs 
71, uhhuh 
72, So he can take me and the baby up 
73, uhhuh 
74, and then I ll maybe come back down with him he s coming back down I
75, guess ten days later 
76, uhhuh 
77, I mean he s not staying the whole time but he ll come back the last
78, weekend of the month I think they said 
79, uhhuh 
80, and then go back down to New York and he can probably take us then
81, breath because it s gotten to be I just moving on my own is just
82, very very difficult 
83, No stay up there 
84, um well and I m going to try and get back to work on my paper which
85, is just ridiculous but 
86, yeah 
87, uhhuh 
88, I m going to make an effort 
89, Well we can both make an effort you know you can I ll finish my
90, book you finish your paper you know 
91, yeah 
92, if you if you haven t distortion already 
93, lthough you know Cuny classes start really early 
94, uhhuh yeah but then don t you have all those holidays right at the
95, beginning 
96, That s true 
97, laughs 
98, That s a good point 
99, I should really use those shouldn t I 
100, yeah 
101, I haven t lone lined up any child care yet I m being really flaky
102, about it and I know I m going to hate myself later 
103, You know I really ought to take the semester off 
104, but did I tell you this is the last year of the xxx 
105, i is that for sure 
106, It s not for sure yet but 
107, uhhuh 
108, um but they ve sent Cuny a letter 
109, uhhuh 
110, saying that the President did not 
111, ask for funding for it in his budget 
112, uhhuh 
113, and it looks quite doubtful that the Senate is going to want to put
114, it back in 
115, uhhuh 
116, um 
117, so that Cuny thinks that this is the last year of it so I m
118, reluctant to take a semester off 
119, uhhuh 
120, considering that it that I would only then have one semester left 
121, 
122, Well anyway t you know this is not going I mean apart from the
123, tenure and the book 
124, you know this is not going to be a killing term for me 
125, I m only teaching one class 
126, and I ve taught it before 
127, uhhuh 
128, so you know and and I and I 
129, Well once your tenure file goes in I ll be ready to believe that
130, but until you get it in I I don t think you should have I think you
131, should have 
132, you know you should not be cutting corners on putting that file
133, together 
134, Obvious 
135, That s like critical for us 
136, laughs yeah yeah 
137, So I don t want you to fee I don t want you to take on a a lot of
138, extra stuff at the beginning because 
139, well I distorted 
140, it doesn t make sense 
141, yeah 
142, w believe me dear once you have tenure I will have no mercy 
143, Good good 
144, laughs 
145, Especially because you re going to be away every summer you re
146, really going to have to do a lot of 
147, yeah 
148, you re going to have to take a lot of responsibility during the
149, year to make me feel like things are at all equal 
150, Right 
151, ut not this not immediately this semester just because 
152, okay 
153, you that you know you ve you ve got a child now 
154, That s right 
155, You ve got to get tenure 
156, That s right laughs 
157, So what was it what was your trip in what was the time in New
158, Mexico like 
159, So 
160, oh god it was horrible 
161, Really 
162, It was horrible 
163, Why 
164, I can t i I was so tense and the baby was so unhappy 
165, because because you were tense 
166, and I think she just 
167, I think that s what it is 
168, yeah sure 
169, because the minute I got here I relaxed completely and she s been
170, just an angel 
171, yeah but I mean that that makes perfect sense 
172, yeah I know it does 
173, Like dogs 
174, yeah 
175, yeah 
176, It was awful th w you know we may get cut off at some moment so 
177, 
178, uhhuh 
179, if we do you know I ll I ll call you when I get to shfield 
180, okay 
181, um 
182, it was just awful they I was stuck up on that hill uh they only
183, had the Legend

189, uhhuh 
190, They were buying a house 
191, They have now bought a house 
192, So they were just out driving around all day 
193, They were completely stressed out 
194, They had finished looking by the time I had got there but they were
195, debating they were making a trying to make an offer 
196, uhhuh 
197, and lexis you know has no confidence about this 
198, uhhuh 
199, and he had the most ridiculous realtor you ve ever seen 
200, uhhuh 
201, um and uh he hates owning property and he and he could only buy a
202, house for three hundred and thirty thousand dollars which was 
203, 
204, exp phone button sound 
205, about half of what he wanted to spend 
206, xxx 
207, and um he was a wreck 
208, uhhuh 
209, and then Joel showed up 
210, uhhuh 
211, Jemma was there and mom was picking on Jemma like she always does
212, even though Jemma s a doll 
213, uhhuh 
214, Joel then turned up the day after I arrived and drove us mad 
215, laughs 
216, Drove us crazy 
217, He was more obnoxious than he s ever been 
218, uhhuh how do you know 
219, You haven t seen him in ages 
220, Well Jemma said so 
221, I think I have greater tolerance for Joel distortion than anyone
222, in your distorted family does laughs 
223, I think you do 
224, I think you do breath but he really was he really was a pain in
225, the neck breath and Jemma said it s because his girlfriend just
226, dumped him 
227, uhhuh uhhuh 
228, um but anyway breath so mom and lexis were freaking out because
229, of that but they have no ability to set any limits you know 
230, So like they can t say to Joel look 
231, you know go away for a while or breath I mean she couldn t say to
232, Judith no they can t come that week 
233, uhhuh

238, uhhuh 
239, nd they showed up unexpectedly and you know they mom and lexis

243, see you later this is our only evening with her 
244, yeah

248, just like a complete it was painful 
249, Good

251, was it was just painful and I j I felt so pissed off because
252, breath 
253, you know there I was expecting a family vacation 
254, distortion I mean it s not so much Joel distorted I
255, mean oh well anyway yeah distortion 
256, I mean it was supposed to be a family vacation 
257, yeah 
258, and it was like it was like so stressful I mean I don t know why I
259, didn t know why I had bothered to go 
260, yeah 
261, nd then you know Eve Eve and Seth were down in their house and
262, mom s all of her energies seemed to be going towards protecting Eve
263, from too many distractions 
264, uhhuh laughs 
265, because Eve had to work 
266, yeah 
267, So you know there was you couldn t go to Eve s house or you
268, couldn t you couldn t ask Eve to have Joel and Jemma for a night 
269, uhhuh 
270, although she was perfectly capable of having Guy and Jenny for a
271, night 
272, uhhuh 
273, I was furious 
274, nd then Guy came and he was kind of a jerk you know 
275, He was kind of harsh with me and um 
276, you know just sort of not very sensitive and didn t want to help
277, with Joel and Jemma at all 
278, We finally made him take them out for an afternoon 
279, I mean it was all just in 
280, you know just ridiculous 
281, nd it and it wasn t so great with Eve either 
282, She she said she wanted to spend a day with me 
283, uhhuh 
284, so I set aside this so I w you know I set aside the day she told
285, me 
286, uhhuh 
287, and it what it came down to was my going to her hairdresser with
288, her 
289, uhhuh static 
290, and sitting there while she talked to her hairdresser for an hour
291, and a half 
292, and then going out to lunch with her and her babysitter 
293, uhhuh 
294, Who brought the baby to meet us 
295, and I thought that the reason the babysitter was staying for lunch
296, was because she would then take the baby away again 
297, Right 
298, ut at the end of lunch Eve just told her to go home 
299, uhhuh 
300, So we d have this we d have this two hour lunch with the
301, babysitter 
302, uhhuh 
303, and then we had like half an hour to go into some shops and that
304, was the end of the day 
305, nd it was like 
306, I mean uh it was almost if she was protecting herself from
307, spending time with me 
308, yeah 
309, It was really weird 
310, um and then they wanted to borrow the aby jorn for their ha 
311, they re taking Emma on a they re on a camping trip right now with
312, the baby
