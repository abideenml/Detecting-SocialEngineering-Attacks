75, while and they al they change it a lot you know 
76, yeah they change the exhibits and stuff 
77, Right breath so I thought we d go down there and have lunch in
78, that 
79, um atrium type deal they have there and do that 
80, yeah and I think the thing is he doesn t 
81, want to go like for a whole day necessarily but if he just goes
82, some place part of the day I think that 
83, Right 
84, yeah 
85, Right 
86, kind of yeah 
87, yeah that s kind of what I figured we d do 
88, nd then 
89, I had a 
90, letter from Mommy yesterday 
91, oh what did she say 
92, She wrote some kind of 
93, interesting stuff 
94, oh really 
95, about Todd just a little bit 
96, yeah what 
97, I don t know if she told you that or not about how they had an
98, offer on their house and stuff 
99, yeah she did tell me they had an offer because I called her to talk
100, to her about the 
101, yeah 
102, cost of the plane tickets 
103, yeah 
104, static and um 
105, lipsmack 
106, I said well what are they asking for the house 
107, nd she didn t know 
108, She just knew that the offer was thirty thousand dollars below 
109, ut Todd told me they were asking two sixty 
110, oh really 
111, yeah 
112, hm 
113, nd he or two fifty nine ni I can t remember what he said but he
114, said they had it like 
115, at two sixty 
116, and then agents said they should put it like 
117, two fifty nine nine or something so that 
118, yeah yeah 
119, because some people clears throat and I didn 
120, yeah that makes 
121, breath you know and I thought they should probably put it at like
122, two 
123, be below two fifty would be a normal cutoff place for a lot more
124, people you know 
125, oh yeah 
126, nd 
127, Well but the thing about that is some people look a little higher
128, than that and then offer two fifty 
129, Right yeah 
130, you know um god that is so noisy I hate it when the girls do that
131, when I m on the phone 
132, com icemaker 
133, What is it 
134, breath The ice maker 
135, oh f laughs 
136, nd I mean it just sounds like an earthquake you can t hear a thing
137, when that s on breath 
138, yeah yeah 
139, um what did they pay for the house 
140, What did they pay two 
141, what two twenty five or something and then they put in the pool 
142, yeah 
143, nd she said she said it was 
144, twenty below their bottom line 
145, So apparently they re willing to go down ten 
146, mhm 
147, ut to me just sell the freaking thing 
148, I mean get rid of it 
149, I mean if they had an offer they should jump on it man breath 
150, yeah 
151, I mean well I mean well you look what happened to xxx on his house
152, and they can take that loss on their taxes 
153, oh yeah 
154, yeah 
155, You know I mean you can recoup a little bit 
156, It probably wouldn t even be a loss I don t know what the pool cost
157, but it d probably be about 
158, lipsmack well two thirty yeah it would be a loss 
159, yeah they would take a loss on it but you c like I said you can
160, write that off too 
161, yeah 
162, on your taxes and um because when 
163, ut Susan s the one you d think would be wanting to get rid of it
164, because she s the one who s paying for nothing basically at least
165, Todd gets to live there so 
166, oh yeah 
167, oh yeah 
168, I know well I know when um 
169, You know 
170, Mitch sold his stock to get the money and build their house 
171, click 
172, He had to sell it at a loss 
173, click 
174, nd we ve taken that loss on the tax return I think next year is
175, the last year we get to take it and he said that ll really hurt us
176, when we don t get to take that anymore 
177, yeah 
178, breath nd I forget you can take so X number of dollars 
179, a year 
180, spread it out over yeah 
181, yeah you can stretch it out and 
182, that ll be gone but you know 
183, yeah 
184, that s kind of a nice w especially if he s going to be a single
185, person 
186, yeah and she said that he 
187, you know 
188, lipsmack said neither one of them had filed for a divorce and
189, that that wasn t an issue the main thing was selling the house first
190, and then they could get the rest of it in order 
191, hm 
192, breath and he said something about 
193, how weird 
194, that Julie has really butched n out I guess she s got her hair cut
195, 
196, oh really 
197, like 
198, short as a ma or you know shorter than a lot of man s laughs you
199, know and 
200, oh jeez clunk 
201, and mother she s so funny when she writes something about she
202, thought Susan was a 
203, man in the relationship and then she said I don t know much about
204, this can both of them be men laughs 
205, laughs 
206, oh jeez breath well Susan definitely wants to be a man there s no
207, 
208, xxx 
209, yeah yeah so e but this other gal s got her hair butched n that
210, short and 
211, no 
212, doubt about that 
213, god yeah sounds like she wants to be a man too 
214, mhm 
215, jeez 
216, so like mother says who knows maybe they can both be men 
217, I guess so 
218, That is just so bizarre 
219, yeah it really is 
220, ut like I said I think the red flags were there all along and we
221, chose to ignore them 
222, yeah 
223, because we wanted happiness for Todd but 
224, oh yeah 
225, oh yeah that was my very first thought and I thought oh don t be so
226, mean don t even say that you know 
227, yeah breath yeah 
228, ut I I looked out that window and they were in the backyard and it
229, took me a minute to decide 
230, which one was 
231, which one was Todd you know it s like hm hm 
232, yeah 
233, yeah 
234, well and I ll never forget that night when they were right before
235, the wedding when she said when she mentioned that girlfriend 
236, mhm 
237, and how you know she thought um you know this girlfriend at work
238, said they would couldn t be friends anymore and she told her that
239, was silly and I thought why is she telling me about a girlfriend 
240, yeah 
241, yeah 
242, yeah I remember then 
243, it s just the whole thing you know I mean yeah 
244, all the little bells went off in my head but I just thought no no
245, no no you know laughs 
246, yeah yeah 
247, I know there s a lady in our office who was married and got
248, divorced and 
249, breath her last kid just graduated from high school and she was
250, talking about that she was going to sell her house and get a small
251, place and she wanted to be out in the country and blah blah blah and
252, 
253, mhm 
254, yeah 
255, static 
256, and um 
257, I d seen her a year or so ago at a restaurant with 
258, a lady and 
259, you know and they acted guilty when you saw them you know it was
260, one of those things breath I mean it was a Saturday night you know
261, bu 
262, but it was kind of like sh and it was a small restaurant that a 
263, 
264, mhm 
265, huh 
266, yeah 
267, yeah 
268, the other people picked but it was like way out of the way and not
269, a place I d ever been before ever heard of and 
270, Right 
271, nd there she was and so she kind of it was it was just a little
272, different than it normally you know 
273, uhhuh 
274, nd I thought that s kind of strange and then I thought they a they
275, kind of looked like they were 
276, you sitting pretty close and stuff and 
277, yeah 
278, lipsmack so anyway then breath my secretary told me that day
279, she said oh Lorena was in today did you know she bought a house I
280, said well we 
281, talk in the spring and she said some she was going to and stuff
282, and she said 
283, mhm 
284, well she bought it with another lady 
285, mm 
286, nd I said 
287, oh laughs and I told her about seeing her in the restaurant and
288, how they acted kind of weird 
289, and stuff and she said well I ve always kind of wondered about her
290, because she is a real man hater she just 
291, lipsmack uhhuh laughs 
292, breath I just figured that was because 
293, oh really 
294, she went through a bad divorce and and he really did 
295, yeah 
296, he 
297, ran around xxx he had another woman and yeah it was kind of a bad
298, deal for her breath so 
299, yeah 
300, huh 
301, ut anyways you know it just all makes sense you know and like you
302, said the little signals were kind of there but you just think oh
303, that s you know 
304, yeah 
305, yeah 
306, don t jump to conclusions you know just because a lady s out with
307, another woman you know that doesn t mean she s a lesbian or anything
308, breath 
309, and then I really thought even if they live together I suppose they
310, don t 
311, mhm 
312, necessarily have to have a sexual relationship 
313, No they don t have to 
314, I mean I ve thought of doing that before and I I still think if 
315, something happened to Ted you know later on and I had a woman
316, friend that I enjoyed and stuff I wouldn t you know I d 
317, mhm 
318, yeah 
319, be opposed to 
320, oh yeah 
321, get a place together or something to share expenses and having a
322, companion and stuff and it wouldn t mean we were sleeping together
323, but 
324, Sharing a place 
325, xxx 
326, breath Each to their own 
327, Yes that s right 
328, It s just too bad Todd had to be caught in something 
329, yeah a xxx 
330, messed up with all that so 
331, Yes 
332, I guess he s still going to church every Sunday mother said he d
333, stop by on his way to church or something and 
334, yeah 
335, So I don t know maybe he can 
336, yeah 
337, find somebody else at church 
338, If he d get another church you know I think that would be better
339, you know 
340, oh yeah 
341, nd 
342, and then 
343, quit going over to see her parents and stuff I think that s just
344, kind of prolonging the agony too so 
345, oh it is 
346, It is but I think you 
347, breath but if you need that you do it until you don t need it 
348, yeah 
349, Right you have to let go gradually I think no 
350, yeah 
351, yeah yeah and when when 
352, he ll know when that s not right for 
353, anymore so 
354, right 
355, click 
356, yeah it might 
357, so 
358, poor little brother but 
359, mhm 
360, He seems to be doing fine really I think so 
361, yeah 
362, yeah 
363, ut it s just kind of interesting and then she wrote some stuff
364, about Mary lakeman laughs 
365, oh really 
366, God what 
367, breath hang on a second I got to get this letter it s just right
368, over here breath 
369, okay

377, juice and my banana and everything um let s see here so I forgot
378, this letter breath what did she say she said um 
379, oh laughs 
380, breath I went out to see Mary last week they ve moved her from

382, is a black woman breath 
383, Mary was out at the nurses station waiting for ill and Leslie nn
384, to pick her up and take her home breath 
385, They told me she s been doing it for a couple of days 
386, She did know me and kept asking where I thought she should wait
387, breath 
388, Then she asked me to take her home and I told her I couldn t 
389, Then she wanted me to call them and see when they were coming
390, breath 
391, Finally I tried to explain they weren t coming and she asked who
392, isn t coming 
393, laughs God laughs 
394, laughs 
395, So 
396, breath my heart heavy I told her I had to go and left 
397, I had tried to get 
398, breath her to go back to her room but she kept asking me why I
399, said that was her room 
400, So sad 
401, I surely hope I never end up in that state 
402, hm 
403, mm 
404, If I do don t ever come see me and break your heart laughs etter
405, to remember me as I was not in that condition 
406, laughs 
407, mm 
408, So 
409, static 
410, trying to see if she said anything else about 
411, Todd 
412, um 
413, oh yeah she said he was going up to altimore for a week so she was
414, xxx sitting yeah 
415, breath yeah she was cat sitting yeah she told me that
