44, right 
45, she doesn t understand that you you don t think she knows that 
46, 
47, I have not talked to her I have not seen her for two months 
48, uhhuh 
49, I don t expect to ever see her have direct contact with her again 
50, 
51, mhm 
52, um she never once said anything to me I mean I I did not she
53, never told me 
54, she never had any contact with me um 
55, mhm 
56, the last time I saw her was when well actually it s been a month
57, then the last time I saw her was when 
58, we ah took you to the airport 
59, uhhuh 
60, that was the last time I saw her 
61, yeah 
62, um so laugh I really I really have no sympathy for the woman 
63, I m sorry but 
64, no and you know she she tried to tell me some bullshit about she
65, was going to um 
66, she said that she was preparing a letter 
67, mhm 
68, on your behalf to be given to some people so that she could try
69, and find you another job 
70, yeah right 
71, yeah right 
72, and so but anyway 
73, that s about it 
74, she wanted she wanted me to know you know she I was right in
75, the middle of writing this letter and all of a sudden this stuff
76, comes down out of the blue 
77, and you know I mean I m not going to give him the letter if he
78, keeps this stuff up and stuff like that 
79, but anyway I knew that was crap when I heard it 
80, I would rather have a month s salary than a letter 
81, yeah 
82, from Shokko 
83, yeah 
84, laughs um 
85, well xxx that s just absolute crap though you don t fire somebody
86, and then go out of your way 
87, to to get them another job yeah 
88, especially unsolicited to help them find another job 
89, right 
90, um this absolute bullshit and especially because 
91, laughs 
92, I mean basically to he told me in as many words you re out of
93, here because Shokko doesn t like you 
94, yeah 
95, laughs xxx 
96, yeah and and you ve never had any you ve never had any real
97, contact with her so I I that s so 
98, right right so 
99, unjust as well 
100, you have bullshit but hm at any rate she s uh she s welcome to
101, uh and I I told the fellas at the labor union this I said you know 
102, w I said 
103, at this point all I want is I said I ll take xxx because I
104, calculated the way they showed me it s calculated 
105, mhm 
106, and I think they actually when they paid me my last month s
107, salary 
108, mhm 
109, they paid me ah about a mon a mon too much actually I m think 
110, I m sure they did that simply because it was easier to calculate 
111, uhhuh 
112, ah they gave me jugoman s jpn for ugust and then for the last
113, eleven days that I worked ah the sixteenth of ugust to the twenty
114, sixth of ugust 
115, uhhuh 
116, juman s jpn 
117, mhm 
118, and I think I really shou that it should have been actually xxx
119, six hundred something yen 
120, uhhuh 
121, about eight eight days or ten days or whatever 
122, uhhuh 
123, and the gave me xxx so figuring that into the calculation I think
124, they still owe me seventeen mon 
125, huh 
126, give or take some spare change 
127, right 
128, and any time they want to just hand that over to me it s done 
129, it s finished 
130, right 
131, but um what I was what I was telling them the last couple days
132, now I ve been saying to xxx and and xxx I said you know 
133, I ve I ve been to I ve I ve I ve been getting some advice and
