103, laughs 
104, and I agree 
105, anyway so what about Washingtonian 
106, y 
107, very foolish girl no it s going to follow her that ll follow her

119, people will do 
120, Well I w 
121, It s it s publicity 
122, maybe going to med school was a great way to launch her career as a
123, Playboy model 
124, xxx distorted 
125, that s right 
126, laughs 
127, Is that what she said 
128, laughs no

145, didn t I 
146, ut does he always want to do it 
147, No and he didn t clean it like Maid rigade laughs would he just
148, picked the papers up off the floor laughs 
149, laughs I I sort of had a feeling that might be the case laughs
150, 
151, He cleaned the ki he actually cleaned up the kitchen a little bit 
152, 
153, di 
154, and made and got brunch 
155, that was especially good 
156, Did you get my message about Hong Kong 
157, that you ll try 
158, and that I should make su 
159, no that 
160, three days 
161, How many days and all 
162, yeah I think I get there around noon 
163, Lau 
164, and that s one of the three days 
165, that s not in uh 
166, if you get there noon that means you won t get like to a hotel and
167, everything until 
168, two three in the afternoon 
169, that s days yeah 
170, so you have the evening you have one evening 
171, okay well I can do another day the problem is that like cuts down
172, my time in Singapore 
173, yeah tha 
174, oh oh well hm 
175, like I don t I don t have that much time I had to leave on Sunday 
176, 
177, Do you have to make the do you have to make the decision that when
178, you go to Hong Kong now I mean can you change the reservation with
179, no cost later 
180, I ve got until like the twentieth I think 
181, no no no I mean once you ve done it and you re coming out here and
182, you decide you want to leave a day early 
183, I thought you know how those things are I could probably go standby
184, but the thing is the flights are really packed 
185, they are 
186, that s the trouble well well the packed flights I sure to Hong Kong
187, might not be packed 
188, right 
189, granted 
190, that s what I mean th th th you could move that par 
191, except there s the flights from there to Hong Kong are the flights
192, back to the States 
193, and we re talking like January first 
194, Well that s true 
195, yeah 
196, and so that s when everybody goes back 
197, but 
198, ut you re not going to change that 
199, You re right 
200, No no not that you re missing the point 
201, the point my point is a United flight from Singapore to Hong Kong 
202, 
203, yeah 
204, is one that goes Singapore Hong Kong U S 
205, It ll be crowded yeah 
206, um U S yeah 
207, So those flights will still be tight 
208, You wouldn t believe how much trouble I had getting reservations 
209, 
210, oh 
211, yeah I would 
212, I believe it yeah 
213, I figured uh 
214, actually 
215, We re having trouble 
216, Now all the places are full because like my ha was wait listed I
217, was wait listed to get to Japan 
218, mhm 
219, and then this this woman Leigh Turbush that 
220, mhm 
221, You know our friend here 
222, She s trying to go to Hawaii 
223, on this week and she s been trying for weeks but she can t get on 
224, 
225, well that s that s uh Japan Hawaii is is very crowded 
226, mhm 
227, yeah 
228, Japanese are just 
229, oof 
230, uh really apparently travel xxx 
231, yeah but I mean the time of year doesn t matter 
232, no apparently it doesn t matter 
233, yeah 
234, you should have heard it was amazing I called every airline as you
235, know only I can do 
236, right 
237, laughs 
238, and I called uh it was with much hesitancy that I called
239, Continental 
240, because I hate them so much 
241, yeah 
242, I was on hold for ten minutes while she figured out this route I
243, should ve known that if it took her ten minutes I should ve hung up
244, 
245, She had me st go from like Philadelphia to New York to San
246, Francisco to L 
247, to Hawaii to Guam 
248, to Hong Kong to Tokyo to Singapo laughs I mean she had me 
249, everywhere 
250, I think they re the only ones who go to 
251, laughs and she d for three thousand dollars 
252, laughs I was like are you joking 
253, Uy 
254, oh I have take fr 
255, in a couple weeks I have to Guam and they re the only ones that go
256, there laughs 
257, the Continental 
258, Continental yeah 
259, That s funny laughs 
260, inhales good luck can you at least go business class 
261, I don t know if I can or not 
262, yeah oh by the way you were right with Singapore ir it s only
263, business class or first class goes 
264, Right xxx miles 
265, to frequent flyers 
266, Right yeah 
267, They go um Singapore ir takes you around 
268, through Europe 
269, they do a route that way yeah 
270, yeah that s how they like to go 
271, if if I you know could have gone specially through Hong Kong 
272, right 
273, but that was more a little bit more expensive 
274, and they they al they also have connections with Delta 
275, yeah 
276, they only give miles on Delta but you can buy Delta seats on there
277, 
278, right well that s they were actually they were going to send me on
279, T W 
280, I almost thought it would be worth it to do that instead of the
281, United because 
282, uh fewer connections but I th instead of connecting in um 
283, eh well I mean it is a lot further to go through Japan and all that
284, nonsense 
285, but the problem with Singapore ir is I have to through New York
286, through J F K 
287, Uy 
288, which I now remember going from the domestic terminal to the
289, international terminal laughs 
290, right 
291, well T W is not too bad 
292, you have to walk a little bit but 
293, yeah no I mean it s just not 
294, shi it just yeah 
295, it s not saving me much if I have to go through New York 
296, but Tokyo is a bad place to layover 
297, Tokyo is a ba and I have like an eight hour or five hour layover
298, there 
299, I know yeah usually yeah 
300, five hours 
301, It s crazy 
302, It s not that bad by the time you slept xxx laughs it s such a
303, it s really 
304, No but it s annoying that I have to go through Tokyo that I can t
305, just fly from Hong Kong home 
306, inhales right 
307, exhale 
308, that is annoying 
309, I m surprised you didn t go Hong Ko the the stutters They do
310, have route where s does it go Tokyo to where 
311, San Francisco 
312, yeah was it is or Hong Kong San Francisco 
313, yes 
314, but it s full 
315, United does have that 
316, oh it s full I see 
317, at that the other I mean at that price level I could pay more
318, probably 
319, mm 
320, which maybe I ll look it maybe I ll find out how much more I have
321, to pay laughs 
322, Can you get on a waiting list 
323, Can you get on a waiting list 
324, I ll find out when I call back to confirm 
325, Yes it s worth waiting l eh with Hong Kong San Francisco San
326, Francisco is much better 
327, where s Tokyo take you to Tokyo to where 
328, San Francisco I don t know if it s the same old same old 
329, oh oh no yes same thing yeah yeah 
330, Well at least put yourself on the waiting list can you do that 
331, yeah probably but I have a feeling it s like a price thing 
332, Might not be exhale 
333, I don t know 
334, End
335,
