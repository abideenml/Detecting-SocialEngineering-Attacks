169, and vodka 
170, really gin laughing 
171, they got schnockered n they they we had a party here 
172, oh my god 
173, wow 
174, dancing around spilling stuff still sticky everywhere you are I ha 
175, I xxx really have to clean 
176, laughs 
177, ah 
178, did you get your rug put in your new carpet 
179, no we re actually in the process of painting the room now 
180, lipsmack oh 
181, and then I can think the twenty eighth we re scheduled to have the
182, rug brought 
183, oh wow 
184, llen is doing the painting 
185, oh 
186, lipsmack I had two sets of students have uh begin elicit love
187, affairs in the same class 
188, really 
189, they re both married to other people all four of them are married
190, to other people laughs inhales 
191, gasp 
192, oh Jesus 
193, So that was kind of gave an interesting energy to the class 
194, was everybody sleeping with somebody else in the class 
195, no they were well they were sleeping with somebody in the class 
196, but they were all married to different people 
197, yeah right 
198, who were not in the class 
199, wow 
200, so that was kind of weird 
201, laughs 
202, laughs it was an unusual class 
203, god 
204, but the Russians are big on that anyway 
205, really 
206, yeah they all cheat on each other 
207, why 
208, because they get married for the wrong reasons 
209, really why would they get married there it couldn t be security 
210, they get married 
211, they get married there because it s the only way they can live with
212, each other and have sex basically 
213, and then they do that so they can live together 
214, but then they re like twenty 
215, oh 
216, twenty two or something and they re not really ready 
217, mm 
218, and then they meet somebody else when they come here they have all
219, this freedom 
220, mm 
221, inhales so anyway that s what happened and it was quite a party 
222, 
223, laughs 
224, w wow 
225, it was quite a party 
226, laughs 
227, it really was but it was fun and I was exhausted afterwards 
228, mm 
229, and then we left now I really only have one mor one week off after
230, this 
231, mhm 
232, inhales and I think I m getting three classes 
233, really 
234, it s not written in stone but it looks good and I have more private
235, 
236, laughs good classes 
237, ho what did you say 
238, good classes 
239, inhales yeah 
240, yeah 
241, and I have uh more private students then I can handle I m turning
242, them away 
243, you have to Charmin you have to take care of yourself 
244, I have to I am turning them away 
245, yeah 
246, I mean I actually am including the woman who I was supposed to be
247, teaching to read who s breaking my heart 
248, did she ever show up 
249, inhales she did show up and she told me this whole sob story
250, about her eye being injured b as a child and 
251, it was just like the lice Walker story except that lice Walker
252, like went on did well laughs 
253, laughs 
254, and this one became lice Walker 
255, mm 
256, and this woman 
257, stops studying and forgot how to read 
258, mhm 
259, so anyway I went out and bought all these books and like threw
260, myself into it heart and soul and then she never shows up 
261, lipsmack 
262, lipsmack she s always calling and cancelling or not calling and
263, not showing and inhales you know her husband called last week and
264, I said look 
265, I have a bunch of students here asking for this time 
266, so I m not going to be able to give two days a week anymore and if
267, she wants 
268, if he had asked for three originally of course she never comes 
269, mhm 
270, I said so if she wants to come she can come on Saturday he said
271, what you re only giving her two once a week 
272, I said she doesn t come any times a week 
273, sh 
274, so it s ridiculous 
275, right 
276, so he said I don t know I ll have to have her call you so I think
277, he s they re going to drop out 
278, yeah 
279, because I think she has so much real resistance to this that she
280, keeps finding excuses 
281, yeah 
282, yeah 
283, so if then I can fit a couple other people in if that happens 
284, but I have to restrict myself during the week if I m teaching three
285, classes or I won t have a life 
286, mm 
287, I know it Charmin 
288, it s absurd 
289, I have no life inhales so llen is like ha definitely don t
290, overdo it type of thing 
291, mhm 
292, so hopefully oh we ll see 
293, but I m I m doing well 
294, oh wow 
295, at least 
296, wow so does llen feel weird that that Fall is beginning and he s
297, not teaching 
298, no because he now has so many students to tutor he can hardly keep
299, up with it 
300, really 
301, yeah 
302, oh 
303, he put up ads and people respond 
304, oh 
305, so he s actually happy because he s tutoring kids 
306, a whatever he wants and uh not what he doesn t want 
307, mhm 
308, mhm 
309, and he s got the garden on Fridays 
310, mm 
311, and he s like doing all these you know around the house things 
312, mhm 
313, so he s happy today was the first day of school and he didn t have
314, to go 
315, lipsmack uh 
316, isn t that exciting 
317, ye s laughing 
318, I m so happy for him 
319, yeah 
320, It s really better 
321, but I if I don t you know slow it down a little I ll never be able
322, to practice the piano I won t be able to do anything 
323, I know 
324, so I m slowing it down a little 
325, I m consciously limiting myself 
326, yeah 
327, or trying to make groups of people 
328, does Mark have classes this year do you know 
329, yeah we we re all supposedly going to get classes 
330, oh 
331, I feel real weird about him I keep having dreams about his wife
332, being really horrible 
333, really 
334, I think that some deep level I don t trust her 
335, of course not she s a Pole 
336, speaking of which um Chicago is also very very Polish 
337, yes I knew that 
338, I never knew that 
339, oh you didn t 
340, no 
341, oh yeah I knew that 
342, and not very Russian 
343, mhm 
344, d uh I don t know if there is a big E S L thing there I went
345, looking for TOEFL preparation books you know for my students 
346, mm 
347, and there was really not much 
348, mm 
349, lipsmack so while I was there I decided to spend a bunch of money
350, on myself and I did 
351, laughs 
352, did you what did you do 
353, I bought three books by ogakoff 
354, uhhuh 
355, instead of TOEFL prep book 
356, uhhuh 
357, lipsmack so now I bought everything I could find of his in in
358, translation basically 
359, wow 
360, wow 
361, I m reading one now called Heart Of Dog 
362, oh I think I know that one 
363, because I have this friend you know who s my former student who now
364, lives in oston 
365, she s like one of the most unbelievable people I have ever met in
366, my life her name her name in Tanya Tatyana 
367, End
368,
