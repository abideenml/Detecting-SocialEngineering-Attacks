104, So 
105, oh yeah really 
106, so that aspect will be done and then um so yeah 
107, mhm 
108, So I m trying to think what else is going o 
109, re you f are you following the pope s visit in the United States 
110, 
111, yeah 
112, yeah 
113, yeah that was a he was a i it turned out very good 
114, That s good I heard some lady died while he was saying mass or
115, something 
116, oh I m sure s there s a lot of people I m sure th statistically
117, there s a good chance of someone dying 
118, yeah 
119, yeah it actually was um the uh the uh the coverage was pretty g 
120, or the um 
121, the sense was good because um 
122, oh 
123, a lot oh yeah and he has to yield his presence 
124, uhhuh 
125, You know how he has his presence and people are attracted to his
126, presence and 
127, yeah yeah 
128, feel that that whole phenomena s still xxx distortion 
129, yeah 
130, um distortion 
131, ecause the Italians made it sound that they he wasn t bein 
132, getting much attention 
133, nd the reporters weren t ready and they weren t they weren t ge 
134, he wasn t giv getting 
135, c uh good coverage in the United States 
136, Well I know before h well that maybe 
137, tr true uh 
138, I mean to some extent I I haven t like it s like I have a 
139, yeah 
140, I don t watch T V so I don t know what s on T V but um 
141, the um 
142, the news 
143, uhhuh 
144, Well in the see before they had 
145, various theologians who are critics of them 
146, yeah 
147, who were um you know saying that you know he s just 
148, he s not in touch and all this stuff 
149, yeah 
150, there there was that aspect but once he was here the amazing thing
151, you know because 
152, it it doesn t make any difference what the press says because 
153, uhhuh noise 
154, because once yeah he has those huge crowds 
155, yeah yeah 
156, nd that and you know there s still like 
157, Mi mind boggled that you know he gets these huge crowds 
158, yeah yeah 
159, nd his um ability to have like instant conversions I mean I 
160, I ve known tons of people and they re just there to have instant
161, conversion 
162, yeah that s good 
163, So I mean it doe I mean granted he the process doesn t necessarily
164, help 
165, Right 
166, but there s something about him where he s 
167, he doesn t need the press laughs 
168, yeah yeah I mean it 
169, yeah 
170, I mean because he s able to get the um 
171, lipsmack you know so that 
172, yeah I mean in in j oh I guess it s 
173, you just become so it s so much part of What you expect 
174, there will be this qu like they ll bring up all these statisti 
175, like like 
176, st st statistics how people 
177, while even while they like the pope they disagree with what he says
178, 
179, uhhuh 
180, d I mean they ll they always do so you kind of 
181, oh yeah that s normal 
182, just become accustomed to it 
183, Right 
184, ut uh I know but just he it s amazing how um 
185, you know i it s i 
186, you know people who laughs 
187, laughs 
188, have that an incredible affect I mean I don t know 
189, I don t know what it is but um 
190, So yeah that yeah that I I ve be I ha I ve been following pretty
191, closely you know through the papers and stuff but um 
192, yeah breath so he s leaving about right now he ll be leaving
193, pretty soon 
194, yeah because he s only staying five days 
195, yeah he leaves today tonight

218, lipsmack I m trying to think of what else is um what else is
219, happening in the big world here 
220, Yes it s just basic ever we r we re back to the grinding stone of
221, papers and uh stuff like that so 
222, yeah

225, uh he s t he s doing like he s principally responsible for all the
226, English translations for John Paul s work 
227, uh I see uh that s nice 
228, yeah 
229, but and um 
230, lipsmack so I it was xxx uh it s funny to hear they re there but
231, um 
232, I m trying to think what else is I I just spur of the moment called

234, now in Italy 
235, okay it s um lipsmack it s twenty to nine
