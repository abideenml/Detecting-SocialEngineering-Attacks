50, xxx distortion last night yeah

52, okay 
53, nd so all I get now is I get some message breath well I just 
54, wh d I want to get a hold of a key when can I get it breath
55, He wants me to straighten up or something 
56, xxx distortion 
57, It s like I m not going to straighten up so this can be like your
58, little nest 
59, I m sorry 
60, laughs 
61, nd it just it just sort of annoys me 
62, yeah 
63, You know if you want to do s do any of that other stuff just go

65, yeah 
66, I don t know sweetie I just 
67, No I just think it s bullshit I mean that s I m sorry but it s 
68, I have to b it s 
69, I know I just think you re getting a little worked up about th 
70, No 
71, I I m sorry I don t got time for this crap okay 
72, That s about it okay 
73, y 
74, I g I have to feed some animals now and worry about that now 
75, nd then this other 
76, oh are you staying over there 
77, rubbish 
78, It s just distorion What s that 
79, re you staying over there 
80, uh I m thinking about it 
81, yeah 
82, yeah well then 
83, why not you know distortion 
84, I just wish you would mention to me before you offer 
85, I did 
86, Well I was kind of saying I was kind of hesitant 
87, yeah I e w I don t know if you asked me 
88, You mentioned it and then it came up to discussion after you d
89, mentioned it to Dougo 
90, breath ut beforehand I d kind of been kind of like negative on
91, it 
92, So 
93, I don t know I just I guess I never really thought that it would
94, be that big a deal you know 
95, yeah well breath Well 
96, I mean um I I d I just think that it s largely because you re
97, in a really high stress situation now 
98, I m in a situation where I need full control of my environment 
99, I know ex I know that 
100, yeah so so 
101, I was just 
102, nd so I think that s why you re 
103, nd then no but anyway he doesn t call and I just all he d i I
104, mean Friday and all he did was give this message today I want a
105, key 
106, I mean talk about a little bit th rude I m sorry 
107, Well 
108, That s really rude if you ask me 
109, It s just like w I I just want to use you for something here 
110, I mean just 
111, I don t think it s like that distortion sweetie I think you re
112, overreacting distorted 
113, Well I think e the behavior indicates that at least 
114, t lea at least you know Mist Mister Mister very sensitive and
115, aware of other people s behavior is obviously not super aware of his
116, own a little bit 
117, So 
118, distortion No you know that distorted 
119, Well no but you know that he acts abrupt like that anyway right 
120, 
121, Well I ll just 
122, I I mean 
123, I will I ll act abrupt then also laugh so it s it s sort of
124, funny 
125, Well 
126, ut anyway 
127, The movie was good yesterday though 
128, breath I a I m I I might call him back Monday 
129, Well sweetie what am I supposed to do 
130, You know 
131, oh you re not supposed to do anything I ll take care of it 
132, ah I I am going to mention to him that I did think it was sort of
133, rude that he didn t do that and all I get is this message blah you
134, know 
135, Well you could yeah I mean I think it s valid for you to yell at
136, him for standing you guys up and stuff 
137, nd xxx 
138, Well it wasn t a official plan but it s not as if he gave me a
139, number to contact him at 
140, yeah 
141, xxx distortion 
142, yeah so I just I was a little bit um 
143, a little bit put off by it 
144, yeah 
145, You know 
146, nd and I was saying 
147, Well he could probably say that he felt put off by you too 
148, So 
149, I don t think so 
150, I was the one who suggested going out and doing something 
151, yeah 
152, The only thing he can be say put off by me is that my h life hangs
153, in the balance and I breath would like to breath be left alone 
154, I don t think that that s unreasonable 
155, yeah 
156, You know I e you know it s 
157, Well I know I agree but i you know um also if you know 
158, uh you re not going to be there 
159, During this week or two distortion or whatever distorted 
160, 
161, The way I kind of see it is like if you want a a so soft place to
162, lie your head down and fall asleep and wake up y cook food or
163, whatever 
164, and putz around once in a while that s fine 
165, ut if you want a place where you know it s it s time for a
166, Saturday Night Fever party I m sorry i e that s 
167, oh come on 
168, he s not quite like that I mean good grief 
169, Yes but still that s kind of my 
170, you know 
171, no he s got people that he hasn t seen for a quite a while 
172, ut don t they don t they live somewhere 
173, distortion Well 
174, laughs You know what I m saying 
175, Well n not all of them 
176, eh I mean I get the impression not all of them can you go back to
177, that place 
178, I mean have you ever actually talked to him about it 
179, No but anyway 
180, Well because I some of them 
181, you know it s 
182, oh I understand I think I understand what you were saying now 
183, yeah 
184, I think I figured it out that 
185, yeah 
186, So he would like to have a place where eh they can come and visit
187, him 
188, yeah 
189, nd so 
190, and so 
191, laughs 
192, It s fine with me 
193, Never mind I thought about a hilarious word play 
194, ut anyway never mind 
195, laughs What 
196, I I don t want to say 
197, laughs 
198, ut that s it s not it s not it s uh it s a word play on what
199, you just said it s kind of a switcheroony n switcheroo it s 
200, but i i it th it comes in it comes i there s some truth to
201, it you know 
202, oh 
203, oh 
204, What s what is it 
205, laughs Well th th he or they can they can visit him and come on
206, him xxx 
207, ah ha ha 
208, uh uh laugh 
209, Instead of coming and visiting 
210, yeah well okay laughs 
211, I just 
212, ut I I mean anyway 
213, nyway 
214, So e my my my thought on the whole thing is that 
215, you know if if you visited him you wouldn t want to have to be 
216, 
217, you know spent panting and spending every second of the day w 
218, with him only 
219, You know what I m saying and that 
220, probably part of the reason that it would be nice to actually stay
221, with him is that you could also go and visit the sights or whatever
222, and g and 
223, Where 
224, What are you talking about 
225, In Japan 
226, I m not going to Japan 
227, No but I mean 
228, I m trying to 
229, May maybe in ten years but no time soon laugh 
230, No no but no you know what I m saying 
231, When you are visiting a town and you stay at someone s house and
232, you can t ever do anything on your own and stuff like that 
233, So 
234, oh I don t mind he does stuff on my e his own 
235, I just uh 
236, you know I mean there s a difference between guests and there s a
237, difference between ownership I think 
238, I think that 
239, I know 
240, but 
241, There I mean if if if I live somewhere you know I can rearrange
242, the furniture 
243, yeah 
244, ut if I m staying somewhere it doesn t mean I m I m I m in jail 
245, I mean just because I m in a motel doesn t mean I m going to
246, repaint the walls 
247, ut it doesn t mean that I m obligated to stay there either 
248, oh well I know but e yawning 
249, I m just saying there are different degrees of you know I I and I
250, don t think he s obligated to sit there and hobnob around with me
251, the entire time either 
252, I wouldn t want him to 
253, yeah 
254, You know I told him I said I have no time to do anything 
255, nd I I said I 
256, Well maybe that s why he was trying 
257, nd as soon as as soon as I move back here he s out 
258, I I I m I m to totally insist on it 
259, I don t care if he never talks to me again 
260, ecause there s no way I can study with worrying about keeping
261, somebody awake or you know I have to worry how w how I m
262, dressed if I m clean 
263, You know 
264, Whatever 
265, yeah well I I agree with that sweetie 
266, ut in that case I think that while 
267, I mean he can stay while I m at Erzhebat s that s fine 
268, That s just 
269, Ex that was my point 
270, That was my whole point 
271, That 
272, yeah 
273, okay 
274, What is the big deal with just giving him a key and telling him to
275, do what he wants 
276, nd 
277, Well I have to go make a copy too breath tongue clicks 
278, lipsmack Do you want me to well 
279, Give him the keys and distortion 
280, You know what I m saying 
281, nd I m kind of thinking about saying well here s here give me a
282, couple of bucks I ll make a copy 
283, yeah or just give him just 
284, give him your set of keys one day when you re studying and say
285, here and bring it back 
286, You know go make a copy and then bring it back 
287, nd 
288, I I mean I don t think it s that unreasonable for him to ask for a
289, key when I e you know at least I anyway 
290, yeah 
291, yeah 
292, okay maybe not you have offered long time ago that oh yes you
293, can stay here and blahdeeblah b 
294, yeah 
295, nd j he knows that you re not going to be there 
296, So I think that you know I d I don t think that it s unreasonable
297, at all 
298, okay yeah 
299, I just think he needs to know that there are limits 
300, Or whatever 
301, That I don t want it I mean I d like to be able to come here 
302, during the day anytime 
303, nd not feel like if I need a book or something 
304, yeah 
305, uhhuh 
306, I don t want to feel restrained because it ll frustrate me 
307, uhhuh 
308, and I won t be able to concentrate 
309, Well I think that that would be reasonable 
310, Just e make an agreement with him at what time you know after
311, what time of day will you call f before you come over 
312, yeah 
313, You know 
314, Or you know so like between 
315, um eight P M and 
316, you know ten M 
317, I ll if I c have to come over then I ll call first 
318, Like that 
319, I mean I don t think that s unreasonable you know 
320, Or something like that 
321, yeah 
322, ecause then he can feel comfortable and you can feel comfortable
323, because you know what s going on 
324, yeah 
325, You know 
326, yeah 
327, nd and plus you know you re going to be at uh Suzanne s for
328, what till the eleventh or something 
329, No till 
330, Well that s right 
331, yeah when you come back I guess I ll be uh I ll still be there 
332, distortion xxx 
333, Still be there right 
334, So 
335, because you ll be around 
336, Right so and then so just 
337, ut you ll be over here packing at that time partially 
338, yeah partially sure of course 
339, I deposited your other rent loan check that came in 
340, oh good 
341, How much distortion was distortion it 
342, nd I it was nineteen something 
343, okay 
344, xxx breath the the thing is I took out 
345, two hundred and fifty out of the account 
346, I m going to pay the electric bill 
347, I m going to pay 
348, M N 
349, I m going to pay uh some other people 
350, okay 
351, That sounds good 
352, End
353,
